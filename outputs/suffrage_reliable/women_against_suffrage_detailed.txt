FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
Male electors! Mr. MURRAY If the hon. Member will give me a chance, I was
about to say I have enquired from many female voters in the constituency, and
I have not found, certainly in the St. Rollox division of Glasgow, that there
is any general demand for the extension of the franchise which is embodied in
this Bill. Therefore, when the Minister comes to reply, I sincerely hope he
will inform this House that the Government has no intention either of
accepting this Bill or of extending the franchise beyond the present measure
before the next General Election. There are certain reasons why I believe this
franchise should not be extended. Girls of twenty-one are, I think hon.
Members will agree, far more emotional than men of the same age. I speak, of
course, with all respect in the presence of the hon. Member for Plymouth
(Viscountess Astor). Still, she must allow me to express such views as I have,
because this is a very important subject, and I think it is one of which we
should try to get to the bottom. 2078 Having said that, I want to say that, in
my opinion, there are very few young men in this country of the age of twenty-
one who are equally capable of exercising the vote in a proper and an
efficient manner. I wish to carry the discussion into this particular field;
that the best solution, to my mind, of this subject will be to increase the
age of the franchise to men to twenty-five, and to lower the franchise to
women to the same age. I do not believe that the country is in favour of this
measure. If the country is not in favour, it means that we are going to go
through a somewhat similar period of strife and struggle on the part of the
women below the age of thirty as rent this land before the War. I think that
is greatly to be deprecated. After all, compromise is the soul of nearly
everything that is good, and I believe that compromise on these lines will go
far to meet the women's demand, and at the same time, if it were carried out
in a gradual way, there would be very little objection in the country from the
men's point of view, if properly explained to them. One more point to which
the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down referred; that is the question of the
predominence of women voters which will be the effect of this Bill. In July
last I asked the Minister of Health a question as to the number of electors
registered in the first register of voters under the Representation of the
People Act, 1918 . His reply was that there were 12,913,000 and 8,479,000
women. I asked further if the franchise were made equal to men and women what
was the estimate of the number of women who would be added to the register?
The reply was that, of course, no definite estimate could be made, but that it
certainly would be over 5,000,000. The result of that, if this Bill were
passed and equal franchise given in this country, would be that there would be
12,913,000 male voters and 13,479,000 female voters. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why
not?"] That is what I should like to explain, if I may. Hon. Members do not
agree that that is any reason for not giving this vote. I, however, contend
that that is every reason. What is demanded is equal opportunities for women?
This is not giving equal opportunities but greater opportunities than to the
men. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] 2079 Yes. In other words there will be very nearly
three quarters of a million more women voters in the country than there are
male voters. Hon. Members say that does not give the women a superiority over
men. I cannot see how they can put forward that contention. Supposing the
women were to bind together on any question, like, say, prohibition.

Hear, hear! Mr. MURRAY Where would we be in this country? We should be in

Canada, and of New Zealand. I am, however, wandering from the point, but I
have done so to answer the observations of hon. Members on the opposite
Benches. I merely wish again to say that I prefer to record my vote against
this Bill, not because I do not believe in women's suffrage, but because I do
not feel that the time has arrived when the measure should be extended.

================================================================================
FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
I beg to move, in page 5, line 28, to leave out Sub-section (4). If I may, I
should like to continue the argument which was not in Order on the previous
Amendment. May I point out the serious results which are likely to come about
from the first two lines of this Sub-section— Where on any representation by
the local authority, or from any court or otherwise. I regret that, owing to
circumstances over which I had no control, I was not here to move the previous
Amendment, which met my point. These words, "or otherwise," which appear
throughout the Clause, seem to me to be extraordinarily vague. They do not
state in any way who "otherwise" is or how these representations are to be
made. It seems to me to be, to say the least of it, extremely undesirable that
a woman who is left a widow and has children dependent upon her should be at
the mercy of any common informer who chooses to lay evidence against her.
Those of us who had experience of these matters in the early days of the War,
before the routine became settled, know that this was a very serious matter,
and we are bringing the same kind of evil into this Bill by this Clause. It
means, as the words stand, that any set of persons, or any single person, can
lay information against this woman, for instance, a neighbour who may be
jealous that she 2876 has a pension and the neighbour has not. It lays the
woman open to the possibility of blackmail. Someone may come along and say,
"If you do not give us money we will lay information against you." A woman may
very easily be intimidated by unscrupulous people in that way. It therefore
seems necessary that in the most definite and categorical way, right from the
beginning it should be laid down that no casual person can give information
and that information can only be laid by a properly constituted body or
authority under the law. You have the words here. "by the local authority."
Why would it not be possible under the local authority to have a committee
which should deal entirely with these cases, and make proper and careful
investigation before any complaint whatever is sent to the Minister? I think
if the right hon. Gentleman would consider that kind of local machinery his
Act would work a good more smoothly than it is likely to do if anyone, of any
standing or reputation, can lay complaint against the woman. Then there is the
question of representation from any Court or otherwise. I quite agree here
that the Court is a properly constituted body, but it is again laying the
woman open to very serious disability. There are certain offences for which
she may be penalised in a Court of law on the evidence of one policeman. Those
of us who have been concerned with social work have repeatedly pointed out how
unfair it is on women that on one policeman's evidence alone—and in a Court of
law the policeman's word is always taken against the woman who is charged with
solicitation—she may be penalised, however innocent she may be. In fact, I
think it will be within the knowledge of Members of the House that, during the
suffrage agitation previous to the War, there were women connected with the
suffrage movement who laid themselves open to charges of this kind in order to
prove to the police authorities the real scandal that, however respectable a
woman was, if she appeared charged with this class of offence before a Court,
it was always the policeman's word that should be taken. Look at the situation
that may arise under this Subsection. You may have a woman charged with this
class of offence. The policeman's word is taken, and the Court 2877
immediately comes to the conclusion that she is not fit to have charge of her
children. She is not only convicted of an offence of which she may be
perfectly innocent, but she stands to lose her pension, to have her home
broken up, to have her children taken away from her, and to be placed in
perpetual tutelage on the word of one policeman. Of course, the Minister will
say this is an exaggerated case, but these cases are happening in our Courts
every day. Another point is this: The Minister will say it lies in his
discretion, and if such a case happened he would be able to put it right. If
it was an individual woman, coming to see Mr. Neville Chamberlain at his home
after breakfast, I am certain a soft-hearted Minister would look into the case
and say, "Of course, this is not a suitable case," but in actual practice that
is not what is likely to happen. These Acts are not administered by Ministers
with soft hearts, but by very hard-hearted lawyers and civil servants, and,
consequently, it is not any real protection to women that it should be said
that the Minister has it in his discretion. If she is guilty of a very serious
offence, that renders her unfit to look after her children; it is in the best
interests of all concerned that someone should look after them for her, I am
not complaining about that, but it would be very wise if we had some kind of
uniform procedure in these matters and, if it was possible, to have a
committee under the local authority, which is likely to administer these
things with more flexibility, more sympathy, and more realisation of women's
difficulties, if the local authority should, as it were, be the Court of First
Instance in this matter, and that if a Court of law finds a woman guilty of a
serious offence, it should at least consult with the local authorities before
making a complaint to the Minister, so that there should be no possibility of
the woman being unduly injured. We are all anxious to safeguard the moral and
physical welfare of the children. We do not want to leave the children in the
hands of people who are unsuitable to look after them, but we have somewhat
old-fashioned notions and we believe that at least 99 per cent. of mothers are
much the best people to look after their children, and that it is very often
the fault of poverty, perhaps the fault of bad 2878 training, perhaps only
words of kindly wisdom and assistance are needed in order that the home should
be kept together and the children brought up properly. After all, it is the
poorest women we are talking about. It is not the woman who is accustomed to
looking after herself, but the poorest and most ignorant of the population who
will be very really injured possibly by this Bill Therefore I want to ask the
Minister whether it would not be possible to come to such an arrangement as I
have suggested. It may of course not be possible at the moment for the
Minister to adopt a form of words but we should be quite content if he would
take this back and consider the whole question on the Report stage. I hope we
shall not have the hon. Member irrevocably committing the House and the
country to this Sub-section. Viscountess ASTOR Many people on this side feel
as strongly about this matter a? the hon. Lady herself, who has put her case
so well. It is an injustice which sooner or later must be remedied, and I hope
the hon. Gentleman will take this opportunity.

================================================================================
FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
I am one of those who, on most constitutional questions, are in sympathy with
those who have proposed this Clause rather than with those who are opposing
it, and for that very reason I should like to tell the House why I regret the
Clause. I admit that at first sight the arguments against plural voting seem
so self-evident as scarcely to need stating, and, indeed, they are self-
evident provided that one grants the premises on which they are founded. I
take it that the case is really based on a conception of Parliament and its
function in the life of the nation which is very attractively simple, and
which was admirably set forth by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for
Camborne (Mr. Leif Jones), who spoke on behalf of the Liberal party; but it
is, I venture to suggest, a very simple idea which, when applied to
complicated conditions, becames superficial and crude. The conception of
Parliament which it implies is really that Parliament consists of 615
individuals, each representing, on an average, with the exception of
University Members, roughly speaking 50,000 individuals; and, since those
50,000 individuals cannot all have their way in the choice of a
representative, rough justice will be done, so the argument goes, if every one
of the 50,000 is enabled to poll his or her full weight in the ultimate choice
between two candidates, every other candidate having been eliminated by the
device of the Alternative Vote. That is the whole hypothesis upon which the
Alternative Vote and the voting proposals of this Bill are based. According to
this view, which regards an elector merely as an arithmetical unit, I admit
that the system of grouping these arithmetical units in geographical areas
which contain roughly speaking the bedrooms of 50,000 electors is as good as
any other; but is that the right conception of Parliament, or of the nation of
which Parliament is supposed to be the mirror? What, after all, is a nation?
Is a nation just an aggregate of 44,000,000 human beings, or has the nation an
individuality which transcends its parts? Has it a head, a brain, a trunk, and
limbs? If so, then I suggest that, as a mirror for such a nation, a Parliament
elected on a flat geographical basis is just about as good a representation of
a nation as a gollywog is of a 2013 human being. Everything that gives
distinctness of outline, flexibility of limb, or clarity of articulation in
the human being is furred and blurred. The real truth is that one and the same
person cannot simultaneously represent stockbrokers, domestic servants,
university professors, dock labourers, clerks, and artisans, and, when these
individuals are shepherded into groups under banners labelled "Liberal,"
"Labour," or "Conservative," it does not really meet the difficulty. It
becomes more and more clear as time goes on that these political distinctions
are relatively confused and fictitious, while the real differences which arise
from differences of education and occupational status are real and permanent.
Not long ago, the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) pointed out
that very view in almost the very words that I have been using. He complained
that so many representatives of working-class constituencies were
stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and the rest. He said that could not rightly
represent the working-class point of view, and he looked forward to the time
when all working-class constituencies would be represented by genuine working-
class representatives. I sometimes wonder whether the House realises exactly
what that would mean. It would mean a House representative of one class only,
and that the class of weekly wage earners. I have not the figures by me which
afford arithmetical proof, though I am endeavouring to obtain them, but I
think it is certain that in almost every constituency in the country,
certainly in the vast majority of constituencies, the weekly wage earners and
those of equivalent economic status are in the majority, and I sometimes
wonder if people realise the great change in that respect which was brought
about by the Acts of 1918 and 1925 in the class character of constituencies. I
am not referring to the fact for which all women must class the right hon.
Gentleman the Member for Bewdley (Mr. S. Baldwin) among those for whom more
especially we are bound to pray for enfranchising women. I am referring to the
fact of the enfranchisement of domestic servants, and I think that small fact
has seldom been recognised in respect of the importance it gives to the
character of constituencies. 2014 Take an example which has been recently made
out for me in connection, with an analysis of working class conditions by the
University of Liverpool. It has ben reckoned that, taking Liverpool as a
whole, the proportion of persons belonging to the wage-earning class is
between 67 and 82 per cent. That is the figure for all the constituencies. I
tried to get figures taken out for three typical working-class wards and three
exceptionally prosperous wards in Liverpool, and, taking householders alone,
it shows that in the working-class wards about 89 per cent. belong to the
working-classes and in the more prosperous wards the proportion falls as low
as 31 per cent. That leaves out the domestic servants. If you consider a well-
to-do neighbourhood, roughly speaking, it comes to this, that in the very
wealthy houses the proportion of domestic servants over 21 years of age would
more than balance the number of members of the family over 21, in a middle
class household they would be about equal, and in the small servant keeping
class of house the members of the family would outbalance the domestic
servants. The importance of that fact is that, when you add the domestic
servant class to the householders in residential neighbourhoods, in the vast
majority of constituencies they bring up the weekly wage-earner vote to the
majority of the constituency. I should think there is a bare handful of
constituencies in which that is not the case. We sometimes speak of the
dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia. Few people realise that here and
now in Great Britain we have the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is an
arithmetical fact. If we do not feel the heel of the oppressor, it is because
the proletariat is innately conservative and uses the enormous power that is
placed in its hands with sometimes almost excessive moderation. I do not want
to have it supposed that I regret universal suffrage, I worked for it and I
gave the best years of my life to bringing it about, and I believe it has
worked results which transcend all that I ever expected from it. It is one of
those great forces which arise from time to time which Sweep through the dull,
dense world, compelling there All new successions to the forms they wear. 2015
If we had to choose between disfranchising the dock labourer and the domestic
servant, or the stockbroker and the graduate of the university, without
hesitation I would sacrifice the stockbroker and the graduate, because they
have other means of defence. All great reforms bring their risks. The risk
attached to this reform is that we may shortly be faced with a class
domination just as selfish and just as narrow as the class domination of the
18th and the earlier part of the 19th century, only with the relative position
of the different classes reversed. I sometimes find myself marvelling at the
short-sightedness of members of the Labour and the Liberal parties who
themselves belong by birth, by education, by their occupational status and
interests to the middle and upper classes, and yet persistently ignore that
possibility. I deny altogether that it is a remote and imaginary possibility.
I believe it is a real danger which is approaching day by day nearer and
nearer. There is a great deal of pretence and humbug in the atmosphere of to-
day. That applies most to realities which are really knocking their shins and
staring them in the face every hour. Just because snobbishness of the more
obvious kind is out of fashion, because we neither talk nor think about the
lower classes or about our inferiors, we pretend that class differences have
ceased to exist. They are just as real as ever they were. They may have ceased
to exist vertically, but they still exist horizontally. A bricklayer is as
good as a stockbroker, but a bricklayer is not the same thing as a
stockbroker, and I believe it would be true to say that a Conservative
bricklayer has far more in common with a Labour bricklayer than a Conservative
bricklayer has with a stockbroker who belongs to the same party as himself.
Hon. Members opposite applaud that, but do they realise what it practically
implies with regard to this question of university representation? Do they
realise that their very cheers are an acknowledgment of the fact that we have
a dictatorship of the proletariat and that they want more and more that the
dictatorship should become not only potential, as it is at present, but actual
by replacing the past domination of the upper and middle classes by the
complete 2016 domination, as far as political power is concerned, of their own
class? I know there are Members who think this is an imaginary danger,
because, though they belong to what is sometimes insultingly called the
intelligentsia, they have found it easier to get returned to Parliament for
industrial constituencies. Are they sure it is always going to be so? Are they
sure that it arises from conditions which are static or whether it is not one
of those instances that all students of political conditions must have
observed of the extremely slow time lag in political reactions? A newly
enfranchised class is always naturally timid and uncertain of itself. It likes
to cling on to the shoulders of the more expedient classes; it likes to select
its representatives from among those classes. As it feels its feet and becomes
more confident, not unnaturally it seeks to be represented by persons who live
the same life, have the same standards, read the same books, play the same
games and enjoy the same jokes. When the middle and upper classes were in
complete domination, did they choose representatives of the working classes?
Is there a single instance when they did so? How, then, can those who
themselves belong to the middle and upper classes be certain that we may not
be faced in the future with a genuine, purely working-class Parliament? Would
they maintain that that is going to be a Parliament which will truly and
genuinely represent the whole nation? Do they think it fair and reasonable
that, because they are in a minority, because the people at the top, the
supervisory people, must always be few in comparison with the routine jobs,
those classes should be deprived of all representation, or that they should
have no right to choose their own representatives belonging to their own
class? Even as it is at present, the fact that the representatives of the
intelligentsia are chosen by constituencies the vast majority of whom belong
to the weekly wage earning class, does not make for sincerity and
straightforwardness in political life. It means, in effect, that most
political candidates have to talk with two voices. They cannot confess to the
motives which animate them or express the thoughts which are really in their
own minds. It is inevitably so, because they are trying 2017 to pretend
equality with those with whom they do not feel equality. I do not mean
equality in the sense that their constituents are as good as they are, but
they are not the same as themselves and they cannot represent them in the same
sense as those of their own class would do. I may seem to be putting up rather
heavy artillery in a Clause which makes so small a change as this Clause,
which sweeps away plural voting, but so long as we have only a small bulwark
against a very great and real danger we had better stick to that bulwark until
we can get something better. I believe the time is coming when we shall have
to revise our Parliamentary system in a much more drastic manner than even the
passing or the doing away with this Clause will do. We may have to see that
Parliament shall become more truly representative of all classes, of all
sections, of all modes of thought and all points of view than it can be on a
flat geographical basis. May I make one point that I have never heard made in
all these discussions. The disadvantages of the flat geographical basis have
been greatly intensified by the housing legislation of the last few years. The
reason is that, so long as houses were put up by private landowners, there was
no danger that the private landowner would put up houses in a particular
constituency in such a way as to strengthen the Conservative, the Liberal or
the Labour party, but now that the great majority of houses are being put up
by local authorities, that is what is happening. There is an acute controversy
in the Liverpool City Council over a proposed housing scheme which would have
the effect of transferring a very large block of working-class voters,
belonging mainly to a particular religion, into a constituency which hitherto
has been almost entirely Conservative, and the pros and cons of that housing
policy are being quite openly discussed as a sort of political gerrymandering.
That is bad for the housing policy and bad for the representative system. I do
not say what is the final way out. It may be by a reformed House of Lords. I
hope not, because we should have a clash between two systems. We should have a
House of Commons elected on a flat geographical basis and a House of Lords
elected on some quite different basis, and it would be merely a pull 2018
between the two. The remedy may lie in a system of Proportional Representation
and, if that could be properly guarded, I am not sure that that is not the
best way. Or it may lie in an alteration of the basis of Parliament, which
would be placed on some system of functional representation. 5.0 p.m. May I
give one reason for specially deploring the doing away with plural voting in
the case of universities. It will have a serious disadvantage. It has always
been my dream since I thought of becoming a university representative myself
that we should be able to cut away this vital connection between party
politics and university representation. Over and over again in my electoral
contests I put forward the view—and I find it attracts more warm applause from
all the audiences I address than any other views I put before them—that it is
altogether wrong that university representatives should be elected upon
grounds of party politics. I use the argument that they should use their votes
in their local constituencies and that through the exercise of that vote they
could give expression to their party political opinions, and keep their
university vote for the purpose for which it was intended of expressing an
independent and detached point of view. It will be very much harder to use
arguments of that sort when university voters have no choice between the two.
There will be more temptation to log roll. If you are in a geographical
constituency where the Conservative candidate is in danger, it may be said,
"You must use your local vote," and, if you are in a constituency where your
vote is not going to make any difference, "You must stick to your university
vote." It will be a grave disadvantage if this Clause is passed. It will make
it much more difficult to separate the principle of university representation
from the principle of party politics. For that, and for all the other reasons
which I have given, I deplore that this Clause is to be added to the Bill.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
I am bound to say that the two speeches to which we have just listened have
made me doubt the wisdom of my first concession. The first speech was alien in
spirit to the whole idea of the Labour movement. The first intention was that
we should have this Committee equally balanced, quite irrespective of sex
considerations, consisting of representatives of employed contributors,
employer contributors and State contributors—that is, the taxpayers generally;
but owing to the special representations made that it was possible that
neither of those representatives would be a woman I yielded to a desire which
was expressed and put an extra member on the Committee. If the sentiment of
the Committee is going to be as described by the hon. Member for the English
Universities (Miss Rathbone) 1363 one woman, or even two women, will be
ruthlessly outvoted by these brutal men who, it appears, will have no
consideration for women at all; and in that case what are the insured women
going to do? I beg both those hon. Ladies to remember that if there is one
voceriferous section of the movement when they come up against something which
they regard as not right it is the women of the movement, and I have not the
faintest shadow of doubt that if we put out any regulations which are liable
to create an injustice to women as women that we shall hear of it in loud,
large tones. The position has been to some extent overstrained by those
who—though I do not wish to say anything offensive—have this obsession about
women. What are the Committee going to do? If there is a danger of a trade in
which large numbers of women are employed being caught by any new regulations,
the first duty of the Advisory Committee will be to call into consultation
representatives of that particular trade, and I should expect the Committee to
inquire of the women themselves as to whether the regulations were suitable
for their case or not. Large areas of women's labour are represented by men;
the women themselves have elected them. I cannot dictate to the textile women
and say, "You must send me a woman," if the textile unions decide they are
going to send men. I really will not agree that that is the best way to assist
the expression of women's views. But I have very readily given the concession
of adding one woman, and I hope there will be more than one woman among those
who are nominated as members, and with that I must ask the House to be
content. Under the circumstances I cannot accept the Amendment. § 10.0 p.m.

================================================================================
FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
Not perhaps for the segregation of married women, but there is a provision in
the Bill for the cutting down of the benefit of married women and the
disablement benefit of single women also because they have 'an excessive
sickness rate. They are treated as a separate class, and that is all that I
mean. Apart from the question of the anomaly in the different kinds of
treatment accorded to the two sexes, this Bill has another defect. One of the
features of the present Bill and also about the recent Unemployment Insurance
(Anomalies) Act which has been most resented by women is the implication 1976
which is being drawn by the general public that women in general, and married
women in particular, are malingerers who willingly sponge on the State, or on
their fellow-contributors, to a greater extent than do men. I think the
figures that I have just given about the much smaller proportion of women's
claims in unemployment insurance to men's, and the much smaller number of
weeks for which they claim, do not at all bear out the theory that they sponge
more readily than the men. At the same time, I am not going to deny that there
is a real difficulty here. The married woman has undeniably a greater
temptation to malinger than the married man. I think there is some confusion,
because hon. Members have spoken as if sickness was a clearly defined thing.
The fact is that sickness is a relative thing. Many married women know, when
they go out to work, that their work is badly needed at home, and if they are
feeling slightly ill, they may deem it better policy to give up their work and
claim on the fund, so that they may remain at home with the children. They are
not actually working at home, but the value of their supervisory services at
home, plus their sickness pay, is better worth their while than to continue at
work. A man in similar circumstances, if he was slightly ill, would not be
able to stay at home. He would know that he would be merely a nuisance at
home, and that his money could not be spared, and he is driven to go to work,
even though it may be greatly to the detriment of his own health. I am not
sure that in many cases it really does pay in the long run for a sick
contributor to hold out too long before applying for sickness pay, but I admit
that there is a certain greater risk of malingering in the sense of too
eagerly going on the fund on the part of married women. But that ought to be
met by stricter administration, and, what is more, it is being so met, and, as
was pointed out in the report, special steps are being already taken to
tighten up the administration, and are having some effect. Malingering is
certainly not the sole cause of the higher sickness rate. There is one other
factor, to which I have already alluded, and that is the sickness which
follows on pregnancy and 1977 arises out of labour, but, in addition to that,
there is the fact that often a married woman goes out to work because she
knows that her husband is unemployed or suffering from short-time or lower
wages, and the double strain of working and carrying on the duties at home of
cook, housemaid, washerwoman, and general servant is a very heavy strain on
her health. Then again, when the woman is carrying this double strain, she is
very likely getting a smaller share of the family food than anybody else.
Every social worker knows that in hard times, when there is unemployment or
when money is short, the woman, because she is the housewife, comes off worst.
Mr. Rowntree writes in his book, "Poverty": Extraordinary expenditure, such as
the purchase of a piece of furniture, is met by reducing the sum spent on
food. As a rule, in such cases, it is the wife and sometimes the children who
have to forgo a portion of their food—the importance of maintaining the
strength of the wage-earner is recognised, and he obtains his ordinary share.
Speaking of the excessive sickness of married women, the secretary of the
National Association of Trade Union Approved Societies said last year: If food
is short in the home, the man does not go without. The wife feeds the brute
because he is earning the money. Then she feeds the kiddies. If there is any
left, she has it, but often mother says she is not hungry. That happens
because as the person who provides the food she has to see that the rest of
the family get their share first. 7.0 p.m. These three factors, the effects of
pregnancy and labour, the double strain of earning and of housework, and the
traditional self-sacrifice of the housewife, very largely account for this
excessive sickness. The question is whether they justify the separation of the
married women's claims and the expediency of cutting down their benefit. It is
a well-known maxim that the most economical method of treating sickness is to
cure sickness. It is difficult to see in what way, except on the principle of
taking a hair of the dog that bit you, it is going to help the married women
with debilitated health through insufficient food not to give them enough to
eat. Married women are getting tired of these attacks on their pocket and on
their repute. All the attacks of 1978 the last six months have hit the married
woman heavily. Six months ago her unemployment pay was cut down. Now her
sickness pay is to be cut down. If she is the wife of an unemployed man, she
has had her dependant's allowance reduced. I often wondered why the Government
were so ready to attack the married woman. The Debate to-day furnishes the
reason. It is because in the economic structure the married woman inhabits a
No Man's Land. The economists used to talk of the Economic Man, who responded
solely to economic considerations. If there is an Economic Woman, she must be
a spinster because no Economic Woman of the working class would be such a fool
as to get married. The married woman of the working class always gets the
worst of it every way. If she decides when she marries to give up her job and
look after her home and children, she is entering one of the most dangerous
occupations in the world. She does not get a penny of wages and is expected to
live on what her husband can spare her out of an income which is no larger
than that of a bachelor, but out of which she has to keep her husband and
children. If she retains her job, everybody looks at her askance. Her employer
looks at her as one who may be irregular in her work, the trade union looks at
her as a potential blackleg, and the spinster often asks why there should be
two incomes coming into the same house. The Government, watching these things
with one eye on their finances and the other on the electorate, think that
married women are fair game. I do not mean that the present Bill is fair on
the spinster, because she too is to receive less disablement benefit, although
she already has to contribute to old age pensions and widows' pensions from
which she derives no benefit either in her own capacity or if she becomes the
wife of a man who is not insured. Her wages are low because she has no family
to keep, but under the means test she has to contribute to the upkeep of any
member of the family who is unemployed. Now, with her debilitated state of
health, if she is driven to claim disablement pay, her miserable 7s. 6d. a
week is to be cut down by 1s. 6d. 1979 I ask the Government to consider
whether there is not some way, which is fairer and more consistent with the
other forms of State insurance, of meeting the acknowledged difficulty. We
recognise that the gap has to be bridged in some way or other, but is there no
other way? I do not claim to be an expert on insurance, but I know that in the
report of the Royal Commission on Health Insurance in 1926 it was definitely
suggested that some scheme should be adopted of pooling a certain amount of
the surplus enjoyed by the more prosperous societies in order to meet the
claims on the less fortunate. It was suggested that in a universal compulsory
scheme of insurance, towards which a substantial contribution was made from
the resources of the State, some element of mutual aid should be included by
which the more fortunate members of the insurance community should contribute
out of their abundance to the needs of the less happily placed. The Royal
Commission declared: These considerations …. would incline us to view with
favour the introduction of a measure of partial equalisation of benefits so
limited in its operation as to preserve the incentives to sound and economical
administration …. but at the same time going considerably beyond the
restricted scheme of pooling which was introduced, so far as Societies
actually in deficiency are concerned, by the establishment of the Central
Fund. Does the Minister say that the means adopted in this Bill is the only
possible means of meeting this deficiency? Might it not still be possible to
meet it by some form of pooling the surpluses of those societies, a very
substantial number, which still have such large disposable resources that they
are able to give substantial additional benefits, such as dental benefits and
convalescent benefits? Is it not right that, in a State system of insurance
contributed to by the State, the principle of equality should be carried at
least far enough to assure that the rates of benefit necessary for subsistence
should be paid to everybody before any group of fortunate contributors are
allowed to enjoy additional benefits? I believe there is a strong ease for
such a method of dealing with the matter. I do not believe it is beyond the
power of the Minister of Health to devise such a method if he wished to do so.
He told us that the means he has 1980 devised meets with the approval of the
great majority of approved societies. I do not doubt that the great majority
of approved societies approve it, because they have a substantial surplus
which they can use to make themselves more attractive to their contributors by
giving every kind of additional benefit. Naturally they want to retain those
surpluses, and do not want to share them with the less fortunate. But it does
not follow that the State, as a substantial contributor to the scheme, should
not say that the underlying principle is, "Bear ye one another's burdens," or
that that principle must be carried to such an extent that the burdens of the
poorest section of the community, the section most liable to sickness, shall
be borne by the men of the community as well as by the women of the community,
and that the whole burden shall not be placed on the shoulders of the
unfortunate married woman or of her still more unfortunate sister, the single
woman who is disabled. I shall have no hesitation in opposing the Bill as long
as it remains in its present form.

================================================================================
FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
As the hon. Lady the Member for Anglesey (Miss Lloyd George) has said, this
matter is one of real urgency. In this report, and in every speech which has
been made this afternoon, we have had presented a most unsatisfactory picture.
From the point of view of the nurse we have had a picture of over-work,
inadequate food, a life hedged in by petty restrictions, bad attention to
health and— one aspect which has not, I think, been sufficiently stressed—a
very poor prospect at the end of a long and arduous training. The hon. Member
for Mile End (Mr. Frankel) spoke of the improvements which had been made by
the London County Council, and I would like to add my tribute to that body for
what has been done, in improving conditions for nurses. But I cannot agree
with all he said. The hon. Member spoke very strongly in favour of residence
in the hospital for trained staff, and said that he desired this on the ground
that women who lived on their own outside the hospital, would not pay
sufficient attention to their food, and would not be able to do their work
properly or do justice to their patients as a result. I cannot believe that
231 the hon. Member who knows a great deal about the subject can have omitted
to note the reference on page 59 of the report to the question of food in
hospitals. The Committee say: It is quite clear to us, however, that the
quality of the catering provided by different hospitals at the present time
varies within very wide limits and that in a considerable proportion of
hospitals, it falls well below what may be considered a reasonable standard. I
do not think that residence in hospital and getting meals there, necessarily
ensures to the nurses the standard of nourishment which they ought to have. I
turn for a moment to the other side of the picture, namely, the present
position of the sick. No one can suggest that either inside or outside
hospital the conditions as regards the patients are satisfactory. If in the
hospital the patient is nursed by a perhaps rather ill-fed, perhaps slightly
dissatisfied, certainly very over-tired woman and by a staff which is
constantly hampered because of shortage of numbers. Outside the hospital the
conditions for patients may also be unsatisfactory. We have heard from two or
three hon. Members of the conditions which prevail in some of the nursing
cooperation societies which send out nurses. Many of them are admirable and
their nurses are competent and fully trained, but the number of cases in which
the patient has no guarantee that the nurse is either a suitable woman or is
properly trained are all too frequent. It does not stop with the nursing co-
operation societies. Conditions in London nursing homes which I have referred
to on many occasions in this House, are equally unsatisfactory. There are many
nursing homes in this country where conditions are unhygienic and where,
again, the patient has no guarantee that the nurse incharge is a really
trained or competent woman. I regret to say that I believe one of the reasons
for conditions in the nursing profession being unsatisfactory, and for it
being so underpaid a profession, is that it is a profession which has been
almost entirely reserved for women. It was indeed for many years almost the
only profession which was open to women. I was very distressed to hear the
hon. Member for St. Albans (Sir F. Fremantle)—he very wisely turned his back
on me while he said it—say that he would like 232 a larger number of women
enter this profession, which was perhaps much more suitable to them than the
medical profession. I thought it a most extraordinary remark. I do not agree
with it in the very least, and I can only say that when I had the honour of
representing West Willesden there were in that constituency—a very poor
constituency, where the fees paid are never very high—at least three women
doctors, all of whom were doing extraordinarily well, earning devoted
gratitude from their patients and comparing very favourably with their male
competitors. I therefore think it is curious that any hon. Member in the year
1939 should get up and say, in effect, that the nursing profession is more
suitable for them and that they should leave the medical profession, with, of
course, its higher emoluments and status, to that wonderful being the male.

I hope that the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Leslie Huckfield) will forgive
me if I do not follow him at length in his argument. However, I would say to
him that, although, as a new intake to the House of Commons, he had to wait
until 8.45 p.m. to be called, I, who was a member of Mr. Speaker's Conference
and have progressed up the ladder of seniority a little further than he in the
service of the House, had to wait until 9 p.m. to be called. Such is the
fairness of the Chair in its selection. As the hon. Gentleman progresses up
the ladder of seniority, I assure him that, night after night, he will go home
frustrated and furious, those great speeches which would have made a
difference to the world consigned to the many wastepaper baskets in the House,
which I think are provided for that purpose. One finds oneself much in
agreement with some parts of nearly every speech made. The hon. Member for
Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) wisely said that, in a matter like
this, dogmatism cannot prevail and that it is something we should set aside.
The hon. Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Gardner) observed, also wisely, that there
is no measurement of political maturity and that there cannot be, since it
must be a subjective view for every one of us. He also said that enlargement
of the franchise will produce, contrary to what so many hon. Members have
said, roughly the same sort of House of Commons, because the voting habits of
an enlarged electorate will produce roughly the same sort of Members of the
House in much the same way as an enlarged electorate always has. I am sure
that he is right. Therefore, many of the expressions of fear uttered in the
Committee do not really arise. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North
(Mr. Iremonger) said that there was great antagonism to this proposal among
the old. That may be so in his type of constituency but in mine I have met
nothing of that. Nevertheless, I intend to support the Amendment because what
we are about to take is a step that will be irrevocable, and I would prefer to
advance slowly, step by step, than to take a step that we cannot reverse. 411
Much has been said of Mr. Speaker's Conference, of the fact that it was not
unanimous, and of the Latey Committee. Little has been said, except by
accident, about the lack of unanimity in the Latey Committee. But the
Committee is not supposed to be debating either of these reports. We are
supposed to be considering the Bill. I have said that once the law is changed
in this way, we cannot reverse it. We cannot deprive people of votes once we
have given them the franchise. We can only extend it. To remark that the
suffragette movement is comparable with what we are discussing is fantastic.
Extension of the votes to women came as a result of a long and arduous
campaign by women. For my part—and I can speak only subjectively, as I say—I
have had no evidence from young people in my constituency that they have any
great urge to have the voting age altered. Not only have I received no letters
from them, or any body in the constituency, but I have not been approached or
questioned about it at any of the many public meetings which I have held.
Therefore, we should approach Clause I calmly and soberly. One of the things
which we should also bear in mind is that Mr. Speaker's Conference took no
evidence which is not available to the Committee. The complaints about
inaccessibility to its minutes simply do not apply. I wonder what effect the
availability of the minutes would have on hon. Members. Some time ago, I had
to speak to a senior form of a school on the work of a Member of Parliament. I
thought that one of the best illustrations I could give would be the big
yellow sheets, which set out the Standing and other Committees of the House of
Commons, to try to explain how the House operated, and I also took with me the
big files of minutes of the two years which I have served on Mr. Speaker's
Conference, and that weighed 10½lbs. Some hon. Members had the pleasure of
serving for three years and if hon. Members wanted to have those minutes, they
would get about 14 lbs. of paper which they would have to try to digest, and I
do not think that that is a starter for anybody.

I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mrs.
Colquhoun) on her success in the Ballot for Privates Members' Bills and on
giving 947 us another opportunity to debate the important subject of the
position of women in our society today. I totally agree with a large part of
my hon. Friend's analysis and survey of the subject. This is an extremely
significant year for women. Not only is it International Women's Year, but the
many events which are being held in this country and abroad indicate that
Governments and other bodies are taking their responsibilities seriously in
this field. We all hope that 1975 will see further developments advancing the
equality of the sexes all over the world. In this country in particular this
year will include several most significant advances. We shall see the Equal
Pay Act finally take full effect. There will be important developments in
social security through the Social Security Pensions Bill . My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services this year sees the
introduction of the Child Benefit Bill . Above all, it will see the Sex
Discrimination Bill becoming law. That Bill will make discrimination on the
ground of sex unlawful for a wide range of activities and situations. Hon.
Members will recall the debate on Second Reading of the Bill. I think I can
fairly say that the view of the great majority of Members present on both
sides of the House was that the Bill presented a comprehensive, constructive
and positive approach to tackling a long-needed reform. Altogether, the
present Government have a record to be proud of in their efforts to achieve
equality for women in our society. We are fully aware that much remains to be
done and that legislation alone, although it has an essential part to play,
will not bring about that essential change in attitudes which we wish to see.
However, it can create a climate of opinion in which prejudice finds it harder
to thrive and flourish. I share my hon. Friend's concern about the extremely
important aspect of women's rights which she is emphasising in her Bill. As
she knows, I have spent a large part of my political life concerning myself
with the very issues about which she has spoken. We all agree that women
should have a greater opportunity to play a full and equal part in public
life. My hon. Friend has rightly drawn attention to the serious problem 948 of
the under-representation of women in one particular respect—the holding of
public appointments. Nobody who has examined the relative number of men and
women appointed to public boards and bodies can fail to detect an extreme
numerical imbalance of the sexes. But it is not a numerical imbalance by
legislation, and in my view the remedy should not be a numerical balance by
legislation. My hon. Friend's approach in her Bill is in my view unacceptable,
because it is inconsistent with the approach in the Government's Sex
Discrimination Bill, as shall show. What would my hon. Friend's Bill do? It is
concerned with appointments to public bodies and to juries. Its object is to
require that future appointments to the bodies listed in its schedule, most of
which are set up by legislation, are made in such a way as to secure that an
exactly equal number of men and women are appointed. It would impose the same
requirement in respect of all ministerial appointments to bodies other than
those listed in the schedule—for example, to the commissions, committees and
working parties. It would impose the same requirements in respect of the
selection of jurors. There is a reference to the House of Lords in the Long
Title, but this is not pursued in the Bill. The Bill is an attempt to reach an
equality of representation between the sexes throughout a huge area. I shall
deal first with public appointments. The Bill's approach has its attractions.
Women comprise a little more than half the population, yet such appointments
have gone overwhelmingly to men. On some public boards there are no women at
all. The White Paper which lists members of public boards of a commercial
character as at 1st April 1974 shows that there were no women members on the
British Railways Board, the British Transport Board, the British Waterways
Board, the National Bus Company and the National Freight Corporation. There
are many other boards where women constitute only a small minority. Hon.
Members have been confronted with evidence of the under-representation of
women in the making of appointments on various occasions. My hon. Friend the
Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has 949 pursued this
matter with great vigour and energy for a number of years. He succeeded in
eliciting information from Ministers of the previous Conservative
administration as well as from this administration We are fully aware of the
stream of Questions on the matter that are tabled by many hon. Members. I must
assure the House that the Government are in no way complacent. As I shall
indicate, the Government are taking positive steps to tackle the problem at
its root. However, I must put some of the issues in perspective. I make the
obvious point that the reason for making appointments is that there is a job
to be done. Public boards have responsibilities for running nationalised
industries. A Royal Commission or a departmental committee is established to
consider and report on a particular subject of public concern. Such bodies are
fulfilling a public duty for the benefit of the public. The primary reason for
selecting a person to serve on a public body is and must be that he or she is
a person whom the appointing Minister thinks can make a valuable contribution
to the work of that body. Although it may well be desirable to secure some
balance of knowledge and experience on a particular body, there is the
overriding need to choose people who are likely to make the greatest and most
valuable contribution as a result of their knowledge, wisdom, experience or
other personal qualities. The moment that Governments lose sight of that
principle, they will get into difficulties. The emphasis then shifts to some
characteristic other than personal qualities. If we start imposing quotas,
there is no obvious reason for imposing quotas based on—

(Broxbourne) Having stood against the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson)
in the 1979 general election, I know that she is an experienced and sincere
champion of women's rights and I have a deep respect for the conviction and
purpose in her campaign to secure greater commitment to equality of
opportunity in social, economic and political life. I say that despite the
fact that she denied me the opportunity to represent her constituents. The
hon. Member for Barking also understands that equality begins at home. She has
fought vigorously to lead her own party out of the wilderness towards the
recognition of women in policy making. I have no doubt that the formidable
talent that she now brings to the Opposition Front Bench has been honed and
polished by debate within her party. I am surprised, therefore, that the hon.
Member, as a seasoned campaigner on women's rights, seeks to introduce a
measure which, despite the undoubted sincerity of its sentiments, is so badly
flawed in its practical application. There is one fundamental misconception.
The hon. Member seeks to legislate for a change of attitude of mind, thus
promoting equality at the expense of opportunity. In seeking to impose
equality between the sexes she will succeed merely in restricting it to a tiny
minority of women. Long gone are the days when women were constitutionally
confined to the Strangers Gallery while a few brave men struggled timorously
to argue on their behalf. Today we are not debating just the principle of
equality of opportunity between the sexes. We are trying to find a practical
solution to attitudes which lag so far behind the economic and social reality
of women in the 1980s. In so doing, we must confront not just the attitudes of
men but even more, the attitudes of women about themselves. Enlightened
attitudes can follow only from an understanding that men and women are equal
but not the same. The human difficulties of attitudes and prejudices are not
confined to individuals. They are pervasive in professional associations,
trade unions, clubs and societies. In this context, I should add, however,
that I am privileged to be an honorary life member of a working men's club. As
reflected by the number of hon. Members qualified by their sex to speak today,
the highest learning curve perhaps lies in our political parties, in which
women remain the exception rather than the norm. The route to changed
attitudes is not through legislation imposed from above. That is a singularly
naive and undemocratic path, the end result of which is likely to be greater
but more hidden discrimination, to the detriment of all women.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde) The Bill that the hon. Member for Barking (Ms.
Richardson) has presented to the House is prodigious in its aims and I
congratulate her on the effort which she has made. It is a pity that I, who
have no wish to arrest the effort that is being made to remedy some of the
appalling discriminations against my sex, feel unable to support it. There are
many nuggets of good sense in the Bill but they are buried in an overwhelming
mass of dross, mostly of an ill-conceived and illogical nature, which is heavy
with feminist overtones. I believe that the hon. Lady is doing the members of
her sex a disservice by mixing sense with nonsense and bringing the case for
the advancement of women's rights into general disrepute. To place the
banalities of sexual harassment, which from time to time is only a matter of
stimulus and response, in the same context as occupational rights and
regulations, and placing the trivia of regulations to force privately run
clubs to admit women in the same context as discussing the merits of complex
pension and taxation rights, shows an over-inclusiveness that is unworthy of
the hon. Lady. I agree that there is a possible reason for the hon. Lady and
her hon. Friends, especially her female colleagues, introducing the Bill. The
hon. Lady is attempting to legislate for her own party's attitudes to women,
which have been less than generous despite the banning of discrimination in
the circumstances that have already been mentioned. Unlike the Conservative
party, which is dominated by women—some might say that it is manipulated by
them —the Labour party keeps women under its thumb, to the extent that the
majority of its regional officers are men. As my hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Burton 630 (Mr. Lawrence) said, the equal representation
legislation met with hostility from the Labour party. Discourtesies such as
those endured by women attending the Labour party conference would not occur
at a Conservative party conference, where equal respect is shown to the
contributions of both sexes. I urge the public to consider that fact carefully
when they decide which party will give them a better deal on female rights.
The Conservative party's legislative record is good; and if the legislation is
sometimes cautious it at least avoids the trap of hasty, ill-conceived
legislation and expensive wrangling in courts and tribunals, which has ruinous
financial implications, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire
(Mr. Forth) said in his excellent maiden speech. Much of the legislation about
which the hon. Lady is worried is already under review. As my hon. Friend the
Minister said, much of it is being dealt with in response to EC directives. My
hon. and noble Friend the Earl of Gowrie reaffirmed recently in another place
the Government's commitment to equality. However, the Bill is not all bad. I,
too, hope that the humiliation of the household duties test on severely
disabled women will be abolished as soon as possible. I understand that the
financial implications of doing so would be high, and that the net benefit
cost to the taxpayer of reducing the housewife's non-contributory invalidity
pension with a universal non-contributory invalidity pension would be £275
million. However, I urge the Government to find a less distasteful method of
assessment.

================================================================================
FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
I hope to disprove that. This may be dubbed the "Divorce Bill" in the public
mind, but it is much more about maintenance. That is revealed by the large
number of speeches that have been made putting both sides of the argument. It
has clearly been worrying everyone. I still do not have any firm views about
the automatic right to petition for divorce after a year of marriage. I shall
be able to make up my mind in the course of the Committee stage, although I
intend to vote against the Bill tonight. I was tempted by the falling in love
and marriage of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and the
hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn). They both seem
to be in favour of having no time limit at all. I found their arguments very
persuasive. However, like other hon. Members, I shall concentrate my remarks
on part II. The Bill removes the aim of placing both parties in the financial
position that they would have been in if the marriage had not broken down, but
it does not replace it with anything else. It empowers the court to dismiss
outright an application for maintenance and requires it to consider whether it
would be appropriate for payments to be made for a limited period to enable
the party in whose favour the order is made to adjust without undue hardship.
As many hon. Members have said, the Bill also reintroduces—and it is a
reintroduction—the concept, of conduct. That concept has always been there,
but in the past few years it has not basically been used or brought into play.
It is linked to the payment of maintenance. When I listened, in particular, to
Conservative Members talking about conduct, it occurred to be that it was all
very well to apportion blame to one or other, or both of the partners, but
that it was the children who would suffer. Apparently, 457 the Bill's stated
aim is that the welfare of the children is paramount. Therefore, it would be a
retrograde step if we were to reintroduce the question of conduct. The
supposed aim of the Bill is to give priority to the welfare of the children,
but I cannot see how it achieves that. It really contains only a very bland
statement of support for children. It then concentrates on spouses. As a
result of the Bill, the children of many one-parent families could be worse
off. If the Bill's principal aim had been the welfare of children, no hon.
Member would have been keener to support it than me. I have always believed
that there should be greater state and community support for children. I am
sure that hon. Members know that I have compaigned for many years, both in the
House and within my party, for increased child support. We, as a society,
should consider child support in a much more meaningful and generous way.
However, search as may, I cannot find much about that in the Bill. There is no
real attempt to plug the gap left by the removal of the duty of the courts to
see that the children do not suffer financially from the divorce. The Law
Commission recommended that the courts should be given information about the
cost of maintaining a child, but there is nothing in the Bill about that.
Thus, there are no real criteria for deciding how to divide the liability for
maintaining a child between the partners. The Bill essentially involves
reducing the right to maintenance of the parent who is the carer of the
children, and tips the balance towards the non-custodial parent. That must
mean less support for the children of a first marriage. The whole Bill is
based on the false image of the divorced woman being an alimony drone, and
indeed other hon. Members have referred to that. That woman is seen as someone
who is lazy, unwilling to work and lying around wanting a meal ticket for
life, but in real life that is not so in other than a very small number of
cases. The situation is much more complex than that. To try to divide the Bill
into drones and non-drones is to deal with the matter wrongly. I deal next
with the care of children and the ability of the caring or custodial parent to
stand on her own feet. I say "her" because it is usually the woman who is the
caring parent. Reference has been made to the minimal study by the centre of
socio-legal studies at Oxford. We would all agree that much more research
needs to be done. Indeed, I do not know why it has not been done. So much
research is done these days into much more obscure subjects, that good
research on this subject is surely warranted. The study revealed some
interesting things. Of the sample which it took of those who were dependent
upon maintenance, half received under £10 per week, a quarter received between
£10 and £20 per week and a quarter received over £20 per week. Many of them
had more than one child. Research done by the National Foster Care Campaign
shows that it would cost a parent in the provinces £23.87 per week to care for
a child of under four, and in London it would cost £26.95 per week. The
amounts increase gradually until for a youngster aged 16 to 18 it would cost
in the provinces over £45 per week and in London £53 per week. When we compare
those figures with the paltry levels of maintenance, we can see that if
someone has to depend upon average maintenance it is no meal ticket for life.
These figures do not take account of any contribution 458 towards the living
costs of the custodial parent. Therefore, I do not believe that the Bill is
about helping children, as it should be and as it states it is. It is about
material support for the first family. Therefore, it is about the money for
the caring parent. It has been said that we should be thinking about other
provisions which would give women the possibility of standing on their own
feet in a real way. I would support amendments which would contribute towards
better training, retraining and educational facilities to enable women to
stand on their own feet and earn a decent living. The majority of divorced
mothers whom I know have great difficulty in finding a job paying more than a
very small wage. The jobs they are able to take have to fit in with their
responsibilities towards the children for whom they are caring. Simply to say
glibly, as has been said by many people, though not during the debate, that
this is an opportunity to make women financially independent, is not to face
reality. These women are deprived by divorce of support from their husbands
and told, "Stand on your own feet and do not rely on me." The House will know
that I am keen to extend the whole area of women's equality and that I am
interested in progressing towards the financial independence of women,
including financial independence within the family. We must provide the
climate and make the reforms to bring that about before we simply cut off
poorer women from the only support that they can receive. I should like to
give one example of how women are trying to retrain themselves in situations
like this. As we all know, we have skillcentres, some of which are running
TOPs courses in manual trades. It has been mentioned in the House that there
is one in Deptford, which borders the constituencies of my right hon. Friend
the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Mr. Silkin) and my hon. Friend the Member
for Greenwich (Mr. Barnett). I accompanied them when they went to the
Department of Employment recently to try to persuade it to allow the two
boroughs to provide, at their expense, creche facilities at the skill-centre
for the women who wanted to train in those manual trades. The matter is not
yet resolved. The boroughs are willing to pay, but the Department is not
willing to contribute a penny. We are told that that is partly because the
Manpower Services Commission must be run on a commercial basis, but it is also
partly because the Minister has suggested that it would be unfair to give
women the impression that because there were creche facilities at skillcentres
there would be creche facilities when they eventually worked. If we are not
even willing to try to help women to retrain and gain a skill, how can we
expect them to stand on their own feet? The House has tonight regarded the
matter with the utmost seriousness but I honestly wish that it would take more
seriously the difficulties of low-paid women — who are mainly married women —
who suffer so badly. The hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) mentioned one
other category of women. She is an old opponent of mine—indeed, she opposed me
in Barking at the 1979 general election. She referred to the older woman whose
children have left home. Such a woman may have been a support to her husband.
She may have no skills and may never have worked. I know women who have always
remained at home — not simply because they wished to, but because their
husbands expected them to do so. Their husbands wanted them to be there,
wanted 459 them to put their dinner on the table or to entertain their
business friends. Even without children, to be cut off from any support—when
she may have contributed to the upkeep of her home through her work there-is a
cruel act. The House should take another factor into account. The first wife
will never become a widow. If the husband marries again, the second wife
becomes the widow and obtains widow's benefits. The first wife does not
receive the widow's pension, nor does she in any way benefit from the
husband's occupational pension—that will go to the second wife. I understand
from reading Hansard of another place that the question of occupational
pensions was raised in the debate there and that the Lord Chancellor promised
to consider the matter. The Bill ignores the fact that many women are not
adequately trained and have not had opportunities to get themselves off the
ground or to stand on their own feet. I hope that the House will look
carefully at the reintroduction of the question of conduct. That will bring
back all the bitterness that we thought had disappeared. Divorce is a bitter
matter, and to introduce conduct will be to return to the old battleground of
accusation. I can remember—although not from personal experience—the days when
detectives were employed. That was a common occurrence. They were employed to
spy on a partner of the marriage and to report on his or her conduct. Surely
we do not want to return to that terrible practice. I hope that we shall
dispose of the question of conduct in our consideration of this difficult
matter. The higher legal costs that may fall upon most parties to a divorce,
and the increasing burden on legal aid, should be examined. The Bill omits a
number of matters that should have been taken into account and to which hon.
Members have referred. The question of family courts is not properly covered.
The hon. Member for Montgomery (Mr. Cathie) mentioned the Finer report. While
listening to him I was struck by the fact that, at the end of this month, it
will be 10 years since I became a Member of Parliament. In that time the Finer
report has come up in one debate or another almost every year, yet we are no
further forward in achieving its aims. Progress must be made in establishing
family courts. Much more thought should be given to conciliation services. I
was interested to hear what the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said
about the experiment in his constituency. We should focus on the crucial and
central point of child support. I do not say in a broad brush way that all
second wives are wrong and that all first wives are right. Of course there are
difficulties, and there is often a lack of financial support when there are
two families. I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) that we should consider a non-means-tested benefit
for people in that situation, and also greatly increased child support. After
the careful thought given to the subject by my hon. Friend the Member for
Torfaen (Mr. Abse), it is a pity that these matters have not been taken into
account and that the House is considering this Bill rather than a child
support Bill, which I believe would have commanded support from both sides of
the House. A number of organisations which are known to all hon. Members have
opposed the Bill vigorously. These include the Child Poverty Action Group, the
National Council for 460 One Parent Families, Gingerbread and the Married
Women's Association, among whose patrons are a large number of Members on both
sides of the House. Although Conservative Members have a free vote, the
Government of course support the Bill. The Opposition have a free vote, but
the Labour party is opposed to the Bill. The women's organisation in the
Labour party has expressed concern about the Bill since the initiation of its
consideration. The national executive of the Labour party took the position
that it was opposed to the Bill. The Bill has emerged as the result of a
powerful, well-organised and well-financed lobby of wealthy middle-class men.
The cost of making life a little easier for this small elite will be paid for
by the 392,000 divorced women who are bringing up families on supplementary
benefit. The Bill is loosely drafted, on what I believe to be inadequate
information. It should be remembered that 1,500,000 individuals are living in
one-parent families, the majority headed by women, of which a high proportion
are living on, or near, the poverty line. The Bill does nothing to improve
their lot. If it had, I should have been the first into the Lobby to support
it. As it is, I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to join me in opposing
the Bill. 9.35 pm

I have no idea. I was not a Member of the House when that Bill was put forward
and I have never met anyone who says that there should be an extension beyond
28 weeks. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's position. Many people
believe, in deep conscience, that abortion is always wrong. I respect that
position. Within the existing law, people who hold that view can exercise
their conscience. No one is required to have an abortion if she thinks it is
wrong. We are not talking about that position. We are talking about people who
claim the right to impose their conscience on other people whose conscience
says otherwise. There are people who say in conscience that there should be no
abortion but who introduce a Bill that says that abortion can be allowed up to
18 weeks. Where are the morality, conscience and ethics of that? It is a fudge
and a muddle, and it is leading to a debate that is bringing the House into
disrepute             At least some of the truth is coming out in the debate.
Hordes of Members of Parliament who are not here yet will come in later to
vote for or against the Bill and determine what will happen. The overwhelming
bulk of them do not support the Bill but say that they support the 24-weeks
proposal. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton) has adopted
a deeply duplicitous position. He had the right to draft the Bill. He could
have proposed a 24-week rule. He could have proposed an exception for foetal
abnormality. But he has deliberately put in a provision that says that
abortion would be al lowed up to 28 weeks only if the child would be born
dead. The hon. Gentleman has the cheek—because, as he tells us, he taught
disabled children for one year — to say to women and parents who have borne,
cared for and loved disabled children who died in deep pain after some years
that they should not have the right to make the choice next time. How dare the
hon. Gentleman and others say that. May I say to this House of Commons — this
overwhelmingly male House of Commons — that it should have more humility when
approaching this issue. When I was 10 I thought that I was against abortion. I
came from a large, happy, Catholic family, and that was the teaching. It all
seemed simple. Then I started to grow up. I am a woman, and my body changed.
Some of my friends became pregnant because men sometimes misused them and
walked away. Every man in this House who has ever used a woman's body and
walked away and did not know the consequence has no right to vote on the Bill.
Women's bodies carry the consequences of such behaviour. If men in the House
were honest, most would have to walk away. 1261

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
(Congleton) It is with some diffidence that I oppose the motion moved by my
hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). I sympathise with much of
what my hon. Friend and her supporters seek to achieve, but I disagree
fundamentally with the method that they have chosen to achieve those
objectives—that of tinkering with our present electoral system, which is
epitomised in the Representation of the People Acts. One of the greatest
strengths of our democratic system is the single-member constituency. I have
always opposed any suggestion of introducing proportional representation. It
would divide the electorate, so that, for example, Conservative voters would
approach a Conservative Member of Parliament to deal with their problems,
socialist voters would approach a socialist Member of Parliament and Liberal
voters would approach a Liberal Member of Parliament. A secondary result would
be that even more power would be put in the hands of the party hierarchy over
the selection of candidates, and that centre of decision-making would be taken
away from where it should rightly be, at grass-roots level in the
constituencies. The people who live 987 in an area should have the freedom to
choose an individual to represent them, whether that individual be male or
female. Our existing arrangements for electoral representation have worked
well, and have not debarred women from coming forward as candidates. Women
Members have made a considerable contribution to the House, to the political
life of the country and to society as a whole. With you in the Chair, Madam
Speaker, hon. Members are continually reminded that it is possible for women
to achieve the highest and most influential of offices, and to fulfil the
ensuing responsibilities with great distinction. I remind the House that the
Head of State and the head of the established Church in this country is a
woman. Until relatively recently, we had our first woman Prime Minister, who
was outstanding in terms of both leadership and intellect. Currently, two
members of the Cabinet are women, seven members of the Government are women
and 59 right hon. and hon. Members are women. The leaders of countless county
borough and parish councils are women. The hard-working grass-roots majority
of the membership, certainly of the Conservative party, are women. If we
consider the gradual manner in which our parliamentary democracy came into
being over a period of centuries and the way in which the franchise was
extended from a limited number to include all adults, we see that the speed
with which women have, in the last few decades, alone, seized the initiative
is truly remarkable. The enthusiasm of my hon. Friend further to hasten this
process by any form of positive discrimination should not be allowed to
undermine the progress which has been made, or to alter the Representation of
the People Acts, which are one of the foundation stones upon which our system
of free elections is based. I support 100 per cent. any attempt to encourage
more women Members into this House of Commons, but I completely oppose any
attempt to change the rules, to fiddle the rules, to enable them so to do. §
Question put and agreed to. § Bill ordered to be brought in by Mrs. Teresa
Gorman, Ms Jean Corston, Mrs. Margaret Ewing and Mrs. Ray Michie.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
(Sutton and Cheam) In case my later remarks should somehow be misinterpreted,
may I first say that I appreciate the commitment of the hon. Lady for
Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) and the enormous amount of work that she has
put in to help the cause of women. I know that she is sincere and has been
working in this area for a long time. In many ways, we share common goals, but
we differ in the means by which we want to achieve the fairest and best
possible deal for women. I admit that there has been prejudice over the
centuries and even nowadays, but, in attempting to right a wrong, there is
always an enormous danger of lurching so far in the other direction that one
make things worse. The Conservatives are trying to keep common sense and a
sense of proportion to the fore. Having listened hard and long to the debate,
and having read many articles and features about the Labour party's position
and its attitude towards women, I must take exception to the way in which 464
it lectures us about the promotion of equal opportunities. I take particular
exception to its attempts to remedy the problem by what I would call
artificial social engineering. Positive discrimination is very degrading to
women. I do not understand how Labour's proposals could possibly help us. The
Labour party proposes a mountain of regulations and controls which would make
it almost impossible for an employer to be able to afford to take on more
women, let alone keep those whom he already employs. Its call for the minimum
wage and its support for the European Community's social chapter would mean
fewer jobs available to women, not more. How can that possibly be regarded as
a fair deal? I see things differently and more clearly. I believe that there
is a very strong socialist streak in the so-called reasonableness of the
Labour party. That socialist streak is an attempt to control our lives rather
than allow us women to make our own decisions. We should be carefully
examining Labour's proposals and seeking examples of what it is doing so that
we can make our own judgment. I was a little surprised that the hon. Member
for Lady wood omitted to mention a vote at the Labour party's annual
conference last year in which more than 80 per cent. decided to accept women's
quotas. In short, it was decided: This conference notes the Party's commitment
to achieving 40 per cent. of women as MPs for Labour by 1999 or two elections
time". I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham
(Mrs. Gillan) for drawing that to the House's attention, but the fact that she
did so does not mean that I should not reinforce her remarks. It is
extraordinary that the Labour party believes that the only realistic way of
achieving its aims is to implement the women-only shortlist in 50 per cent. of
seats where a sitting Labour Member of Parliament is not standing for re-
election. Not surprisingly, the move has been scorned by some Labour Members.
The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) was reported
in the Evening Standard of 23 November as saying that the plan was wrong in
principle and probably unworkable in practice". How right he is.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
(North Down) I am sorry that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough
(Helen Jackson) is no longer in the Chamber, as I should have liked to thank
her for her kind words about how active women are in communities in Northern
Ireland. I want to add to her remarks by bringing a Northern Ireland
perspective to our debate and registering the Ulster Unionist party's deep
concern that the Bill may result in positive discrimination. We in Northern
Ireland have just embarked on a form of positive discrimination that we find
deeply divisive and counter-productive; I shall speak about that in due
course. I am one of only three women in Parliament who represent
constituencies in Northern Ireland out of a total of 18 MPs in that part of
the United Kingdom. Of course, that is a deeply unsatisfactory state of
affairs, but it is a great improvement when one considers that for the last 30
years or so all our MPs were men. However, the House might also note—this
gives me no pleasure—that the total of three is inflated, as the Member for
Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Michelle Gildernew) achieved her 53-vote 366
majority only with the aid of intimidatory tactics in a polling station. Those
tactics were described only last Friday by Lord Chief Justice Carswell in an
electoral court in his home town of Belfast as "extremely reprehensible".
There is little doubt that women are grossly under-represented in political
life in Northern Ireland. particularly when compared to other regions of the
United Kingdom. I understand that 42 per cent. of Members of the National
Assembly for Wales are women. The figure falls to 37 per cent. for membership
of the Scottish Parliament. Much worse is the figure for the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, where just 13 per cent. of Members are women. I am glad to
see the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough back in her place, and I thank
her. Fortunately, the Belfast agreement was not silent about the role of women
in public life. As a strong supporter of the agreement, I was pleased that it
enshrined, among many things, a clear commitment by all the parties to the
right of women to full and equal political participation". That is a
commitment which the Ulster Unionist party greatly welcomed and still does.
The agreement also included a provision whereby all the parties affirmed the
right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of
class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity". Given the central themes of
equality and nondiscrimination which run through the Belfast agreement, which
I repeat that I welcome, my party would be strongly opposed to any legislation
that ran counter to those themes. We in the UUP are opposed to all forms of
discrimination, including positive discrimination. I alluded earlier to a
recent example of positive discrimination. It relates to the recruitment
process for the new Police Service of Northern Ireland. For the benefit of
right hon. and hon. Members who might not be aware of the fact, I should
explain that the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 incorporated a provision
which legalised religious discrimination in recruitment, so that 50 per cent.
of recruits would come from the Roman Catholic community and the other 50 per
cent. would not. In practice, that means that Jewish, Protestant, Chinese,
atheist and Muslim recruits who have made it through all the tests on merit
may nevertheless be rejected on the grounds of their community
background—their religion. My party shares the desire to make the Police
Service of Northern Ireland much more representative of the entire community,
but we emphatically do not believe that the discriminatory recruitment policy
is the way forward. We believe it to be counter-productive and divisive for
the new Police Service, and that is not what I wish to see. Likewise, we
believe that if the selection of political candidates were brought about by
positive discrimination, it would be counter-productive and divisive. I have
listened carefully to the debate and the contributions from other right hon.
and hon. Members. We need a much clearer understanding of the reasons behind
the low numbers of women in political life throughout the United Kingdom. I
therefore commend to the House the work of the recently established centre for
the advancement of women into politics. I must declare that I sit on a
voluntary basis as a member of its advisory board. The centre was launched
last month, 367 on 28 September 2001. It is based in the school of politics in
Queen's university, Belfast, and aims to foster an appreciation of women's
contribution to politics, government and public decision making in the United
Kingdom and Ireland. I believe it to be the only centre of its kind in Europe.
The centre considers women's political participation as having two important
dimensions: the proportion of women in decision making, and the inclusion of
women's perspectives in Government policies and programmes. I take the
opportunity to pay tribute to its director, Yvonne Galligan, and also to the
lady who opened the centre, who is no other than Mary McAleese, formerly of
Queen's university and now the President of the Republic of Ireland. I think
that President Mary McAleese's well-deserved rise to become her country's
elected Head of State demonstrates that the correct blend of determination and
ability can bring political dividends for a woman in these islands. I
appreciate that the Bill is permissive, as opposed to prescriptive. However,
although the Ulster Unionist party will always support equality we shall not
be persuaded to support positive discrimination. § 9 pm

FULL SPEECH TEXT:
================================================================================
There were certainly none today. Many questions have been asked about the
measures that hon. Members would take. I want energetic recruitment,
mentoring, coaching and monitoring. I want best practice guidance. Selection
panels should be required to undertake training and outsiders should monitor
their activities. I want vigorous positive action. I should find an all-woman
shortlist extremely invidious in constituencies—whether parliamentary,
European or council—where there was only one elected representative. The
person who most persuaded me of that was the late Baroness Seear—a most
distinguished woman. She pointed out that once we say that there must be a
woman, next we shall say that there must be a disabled person, an ethnic
minority person, somebody aged over 60, or somebody in their 20s. Above all,
we are elected to represent all the people, whether or not they voted for us,
and whatever their gender, race or age. I find all-women shortlists, or indeed
twinning, extraordinarily invidious. Were they to apply, I should have to
think carefully about my interpretation of the role of a Member of Parliament.
I remain concerned about why we should want such different arrangements for
Members of Parliament compared with other occupations and professions. The
Minister did not adequately address that point in his brief summing up on
Second Reading, or in his remarks in Committee and the debate today. The point
about redress through employment law is one element, but it is not a complete
answer. The House will be aware that, at present, the civil service is,
rightly, making a great effort to try to promote diversity, so that public
servants reflect the Britain of today. I strongly welcome that, but few
permanent secretaries are women and few come from ethnic minorities. The
majority of medical students are women, but the majority of consultants are
not. I gave an example on Second Reading—about which I have received an
enormous amount of correspondence—of a primary school with an all-female staff
and asked whether an all-male shortlist would be permitted. The answer is that
it would not. The issues arise in other sectors. Last week, black police
officers met in Manchester. There are real issues about ethnic minorities in
the police force and the services. In social work, there is a real desire to
appoint more black and ethnic minority social workers and inspectors. In all
these sectors, positive action—legal or illegal—is under way. Coaching and
mentoring are available. People are being encouraged to come forward. As long
as an appointment is made on merit, people in the public services have become
fairly vigorous—rightly so—in saying that the public face of those services
should reflect the diversity of Britain today. I fail to understand why
Members of Parliament are such a different case. We should reflect the
diversity of Britain today. We should take all the steps taken by others and
we should not be thought to be legislating for ourselves in a vacuum, as
though we were blinkered. 914 Similarly, I find it difficult to support
measures relating to women rather than considering other ways to make us look
as though we were more representative of Britain. At a time when 40 per cent.
of the electorate fail to vote, we are missing out. We are not registering
with the public—whether that is about gender, or age, none of us really knows.
I commend those who have worked so hard on the Bill. I worry whether the ends
justify the means. It seems like a form of social engineering to treat
politicians as a special case. I continue to find that disturbing, but I, with
others, will continue to do everything in my power to encourage more women to
come forward, more selection committees to choose women and more members of
the electorate to vote for them. 6.55 pm
