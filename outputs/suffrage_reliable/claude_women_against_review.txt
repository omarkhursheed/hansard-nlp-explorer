Male electors! Mr. MURRAY If the hon. Member will give me a chance, I was about to say I have enquired from many female voters in the constituency, and I have not found, certainly in the St. Rollox division of Glasgow, that there is any general demand for the extension of the franchise which is embodied in this Bill. Therefore, when the Minister comes to reply, I sincerely hope he will inform this House that the Government has no intention either of accepting this Bill or of extending the franchise beyond the present measure before the next General Election. There are certain reasons why I believe this franchise should not be extended. Girls of twenty-one are, I think hon. Members will agree, far more emotional than men of the same age. I speak, of course, with all respect in the presence of the hon. Member for Plymouth (Viscountess Astor). Still, she must allow me to express such views as I have, because this is a very important subject, and I think it is one of which we should try to get to the bottom. 2078 Having said that, I want to say that, in my opinion, there are very few young men in this country of the age of twenty-one who are equally capable of exercising the vote in a proper and an efficient manner. I wish to carry the discussion into this particular field; that the best solution, to my mind, of this subject will be to increase the age of the franchise to men to twenty-five, and to lower the franchise to women to the same age. I do not believe that the country is in favour of this measure. If the country is not in favour, it means that we are going to go through a somewhat similar period of strife and struggle on the part of the women below the age of thirty as rent this land before the War. I think that is greatly to be deprecated. After all, compromise is the soul of nearly everything that is good, and I believe that compromise on these lines will go far to meet the women's demand, and at the same time, if it were carried out in a gradual way, there would be very little objection in the country from the men's point of view, if properly explained to them. One more point to which the hon. Gentleman who has just sat down referred; that is the question of the predominence of women voters which will be the effect of this Bill. In July last I asked the Minister of Health a question as to the number of electors registered in the first register of voters under the Representation of the People Act, 1918 . His reply was that there were 12,913,000 and 8,479,000 women. I asked further if the franchise were made equal to men and women what was the estimate of the number of women who would be added to the register? The reply was that, of course, no definite estimate could be made, but that it certainly would be over 5,000,000. The result of that, if this Bill were passed and equal franchise given in this country, would be that there would be 12,913,000 male voters and 13,479,000 female voters. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] That is what I should like to explain, if I may. Hon. Members do not agree that that is any reason for not giving this vote. I, however, contend that that is every reason. What is demanded is equal opportunities for women? This is not giving equal opportunities but greater opportunities than to the men. [HON. MEMBERS: "No!"] 2079 Yes. In other words there will be very nearly three quarters of a million more women voters in the country than there are male voters. Hon. Members say that does not give the women a superiority over men. I cannot see how they can put forward that contention. Supposing the women were to bind together on any question, like, say, prohibition.

That was the interpretation that I put upon the right hon. Gentleman's words. But does he deny that graduates have a special kind of contribution to make to the collective wisdom of Parliament, that a large number of them not only have special interest in scientific research but are engaged perhaps in those great industries that are menaced and that value the need of scientific research, that great numbers of them are engaged in education, which is becoming more and more under the control of Parliament, and that they even have professional interests of their own which deserve sympathetic consideration? Why are they not to get it? Because they have forfeited their claim to that consideration by, in the past, voting usually for Conservative candidates. The right hon. Gentleman gave a quotation from Lecky the historian, to show that the political influence of the universities has been almost uniformly hostile to political progress. How is that quotation relevant to the universities of to-day? Would the right hon. Gentleman think it fair to accuse the universities of to-day of religious bigotry, because the universities of 100 years ago excluded Roman Catholics, Jews, and Unitarians from their privileges? Might I appeal from Lecky the historian to Lecky the political philosopher, who wrote Surely it is impossible to exaggerate the fatuity of these attacks upon university representation; and the men who make them have rarely the excuse of honest ignorance. With many the true motive is simply a desire to extinguish constituencies which return members opposed to their politics, and at the same time, by depreciating the great centres of intelligence, to 1720 flatter the more ignorant voters. It is a truth which should never be forgotten, that in the field of politics the spirit of servility and sycophancy"— Nobody could accuse the right hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) of servility and sycophancy— no longer shows itself in the adulation of kings and nobles. Faithful to its old instinct of grovelling at the feet of power, it now carries its homage to another shrine. I shall be told that Lecky was no believer in democracy and, further, that the universities continue in their bad old ways of returning Conservatives to Parliament. May I deal very shortly with both points? If Lecky was no democrat, one would scarcely deny that title to John Stuart Mill. I have already mentioned that John Stuart Mill believed in proportional representation, like the right hon. Member for Darwen and his followers, and may I make the point incidentally, as a proof of his far sighted wisdom, that Mill foresaw a danger on which Continental systems of proportional representation have wrecked themselves, namely, that too large constituencies, by destroying all real contact between electors and candidates, would lead to the tyranny of a party list. Therefore, he recommended three-member constituencies, no more and no less. 8.0 p.m. Did Mill think that Proportional Representation by itself was an adequate safeguard for the representation of minorities? Not at all. He actually advocated plural voting based, not on property, but on educational attainments. He actually wanted a graduated scale culminating in graduates with five or six votes. That proposal might find few supporters to-day, but that it could be entertained by so great and genuine a democrat should make those think who argue that because the university franchise confers two votes on some graduates that is sufficient reason for sweeping away the whole system. I do not regard plural voting as the most useful element in university representation. The value of votes to-day depends mainly on how they are grouped. We have learnt to recognise that only where voters are sufficiently massed can they really make themselves effective so that they can control elections. The value of the university franchise I believe to be that it singles out university voters from the mass of 1721 men and women belonging to other occupations and interests, and provides them with a special channel for reflecting their opinions in Parliament. Do we really think so very lightly of education that it seems quite indefensible that the better-trained minds of the community should be provided with a special channel reflecting their views? Do we really think that mental training does not count I am not suggesting that the university is the only place of mental training. We have in this House men, among the ablest in all three parties, who have not been to universities. They are self educated, and that perhaps is the best form of education. But they have shown, every one of them, what they themselves think of university training, by taking care to see that their own sons and daughters should have the advantage of that training. Broadly speaking, is it not true that mental training does tend to broaden the mind, and that those who have received it are more likely to make valuable contributions to the work of legislating and administering on all these vastly complicated legal and sociological problems with which the Parliament of to-day has to deal? Are we so sure that the Parliaments of the future will provide means of making full use of these trained minds without some such provision as university representation I have not forgotten what the Prime Minister said about the debt which all the parties in this House owe to the universities. Are we quite so sure that this is always going to be so? Is not some of the enthusiasm with which the abolition of university representation has been received by some hon. Members opposite a. sign of the kind of jealousy some of them feel towards those who have enjoyed these educational privileges? Do not we find, it always is the case in every fresh advance of the franchise—it was so when women were newly enfranchised—that all those who fear its extension beforehand have anticipated that Parliament is going to be invaded by a great horde of persons of the same class as the new voters It was expected that great hordes of working men in fustian would invade Parliament when the working man was given the vote, and there were similar expectations when the agricultural labourers got their vote, and 1722 when women got their vote. I believe there were special arrangements made in this House to accommodate the numbers of women who were expected. What actually happened? One finds that a newly enfranchised class of voters clings to precedent and elects people of the sort that have preceded. But like a new skater, as they get more confidence and experience, they shake off the arm of the expert, they want to move alone and are perfectly confident of their ability to contribute all the wisdom that may be needed. We heard a very interesting speech last night from the hon. Member for South Cardiff (Mr. A. Henderson, junr.), himself a graduate of Cambridge, who told us he had no desire to see university representation in Parliament, because he did not believe in vocational and functional representation. Does he deny that we have actually in the Parliament of to-day vocational and specialised representation, but only in a number of industries which happen incidentally to be localised in large masses? They are able to return their special representatives to Parliament, to nominate them and even to aid them financially. If there is to be such representation, is it not better that it should be direct and acknowledged than that it should be accidental and incidental? In the days of laissez faire, when Parliament dealt with a restricted number of questions, it may have been possible to avoid a Parliament based to a considerable extent on functions, and including representation not only of political parties but of big industrial interests. Is it possible in the Parliament of to-day? There is no sign at all that those who exercise so ably and vigorously their rights of representation of trade unions are going to give up their rights to represent these special interests. Why should not the brain workers and the upper and supervisory trade workers have some special channel of representation and security? It is quite possible that university representation may not be the ideal means of doing that. Possibly when we have proportional representation—the effect of which is a matter of very great speculation—we may find it would so effectively secure the representation of minority points of view 1723 that we should not need university representation. Then let us wait until we have got it. As for the argument that because universities have usually returned a Conservative they will always continue to do so, was there ever such an instance of the time-lag in political thought? Platitudes are always irritating, but none is so irritating as a platitude which is not even true. That university representation is an anachronism is a platitude I have heard often lately. It may be good or bad, but an anachronism it is not. Might it not be better compared to a seven months child, born prematurely into a world for which it was not yet fitted and of which it had no need? In the days when Parliament was mostly composed of the representatives of one class, one religion, and one sex, and when universities represented the same class, the same sex, and the same religion, what was the need for any special channel for securing representation of the universities in Parliament? To-day, how changed is the whole position and how completely that class privilege in university education has passed away. Other speakers have referred to the great change that has come over the modern university now that the broad highway to those universities has been securely laid and is being trod every year by an increasing multitude of the sons and daughters of the working-classes. I would like to reply to something said last night by the Minister of Health, who said that Professor Gilbert Murray would never be a representative of Oxford. I would suggest that, if that is so, it is because his party is sweeping away the representation of the University of Oxford. If one considers the figures at his last contest, Professor Murray got 1,100 more votes than the Tory candidate below him on the list, and it was only because of second preferences that he was placed in a minority of 583 on the final count. Does the Minister of Health really consider that a minority of 500 votes makes it inconceivable that Oxford would ever return that great and distinguished internationalist to the House of Commons? Though I am a daughter of Oxford, I am intensely proud of the fact that I 1724 represent in this House one ancient and seven of the modern universities. I want to tell the House the result of my observations of the graduates in these newer universities. I believe that what the younger men and women at the universities desire in their representatives is that they shall reflect something of what they believe to be characteristic of the spirit of the universities themselves. What they do not want is that their university vote shall continue to be used as a mere duplication of their party record. They recognise the need for vitalising and freeing university representation from the ascendency of party wire-pullers, and the representatives they desire in the future are representatives who shall more represent that independent point of view. I realise that I lay myself open to the jibe that if this is what the universities want they have chosen badly. Let it be so. We are no doubt marred vessels, cracked conduit pipes to bring the fresh waters of the university into Parliament. But do not make the mistake of judging the future by the past. What are the characteristics of the universities? An impartial outlook on facts, a desire to see truth from whatever quarter it comes, and above all a desire for the good of the whole rather than the good of the individual or of the sectional interests: Drive my dead thoughts over the Universe Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth. That is or should be the spirit of the universities. Can anyone say that it is the spirit of the party politicians? How many party politicians would not see the foliage and fruitage of their minds crackle and go up in smoke rather than help to quicken the growth of a harvest which was to be garnered by any political party other than their own? I cannot vote for this Bill because it affronts my constituents and abolishes my constituency. Nor can I vote against it because I believe that there is much in it that is good. Therefore, I shall abstain from voting on the Second Reading, but I appeal to the House to give this Measure a careful reconsideration during the Committee stage and to consider whether even from the narrow view of party advantage, 1725 those parties who think that they have something to gain by the abolition of university representation may not find that they have a great deal more to lose by alienating those people numerically weak perhaps but strong in influence in their several constituencies, the men and women who value their university votes and who regard this Measure as a vote of censure on the way in which those votes have been exercised in the past. The supporters of the Bill may find that by this provision they have swept away an institution which, though it may have worked faultily in the past, though it may perhaps have worked through faulty instruments, yet may do much, in these new Parliaments elected by enormous constituencies to bring to bear the influence of people who stand aloof from party politics and who are able to apply themselves to the problems of the time with that love of truth and that intellectual detachment which characterise the universities.

  "I find all-women shortlists, or indeed twinning, extraordinarily invidious."

================================================================================
FULL TEXT:
================================================================================
There were certainly none today. Many questions have been asked about the measures that hon. Members would take. I want energetic recruitment, mentoring, coaching and monitoring. I want best practice guidance. Selection panels should be required to undertake training and outsiders should monitor their activities. I want vigorous positive action. I should find an all-woman shortlist extremely invidious in constituencies—whether parliamentary, European or council—where there was only one elected representative. The person who most persuaded me of that was the late Baroness Seear—a most distinguished woman. She pointed out that once we say that there must be a woman, next we shall say that there must be a disabled person, an ethnic minority person, somebody aged over 60, or somebody in their 20s. Above all, we are elected to represent all the people, whether or not they voted for us, and whatever their gender, race or age. I find all-women shortlists, or indeed twinning, extraordinarily invidious. Were they to apply, I should have to think carefully about my interpretation of the role of a Member of Parliament. I remain concerned about why we should want such different arrangements for Members of Parliament compared with other occupations and professions. The Minister did not adequately address that point in his brief summing up on Second Reading, or in his remarks in Committee and the debate today. The point about redress through employment law is one element, but it is not a complete answer. The House will be aware that, at present, the civil service is, rightly, making a great effort to try to promote diversity, so that public servants reflect the Britain of today. I strongly welcome that, but few permanent secretaries are women and few come from ethnic minorities. The majority of medical students are women, but the majority of consultants are not. I gave an example on Second Reading—about which I have received an enormous amount of correspondence—of a primary school with an all-female staff and asked whether an all-male shortlist would be permitted. The answer is that it would not. The issues arise in other sectors. Last week, black police officers met in Manchester. There are real issues about ethnic minorities in the police force and the services. In social work, there is a real desire to appoint more black and ethnic minority social workers and inspectors. In all these sectors, positive action—legal or illegal—is under way. Coaching and mentoring are available. People are being encouraged to come forward. As long as an appointment is made on merit, people in the public services have become fairly vigorous—rightly so—in saying that the public face of those services should reflect the diversity of Britain today. I fail to understand why Members of Parliament are such a different case. We should reflect the diversity of Britain today. We should take all the steps taken by others and we should not be thought to be legislating for ourselves in a vacuum, as though we were blinkered. 914 Similarly, I find it difficult to support measures relating to women rather than considering other ways to make us look as though we were more representative of Britain. At a time when 40 per cent. of the electorate fail to vote, we are missing out. We are not registering with the public—whether that is about gender, or age, none of us really knows. I commend those who have worked so hard on the Bill. I worry whether the ends justify the means. It seems like a form of social engineering to treat politicians as a special case. I continue to find that disturbing, but I, with others, will continue to do everything in my power to encourage more women to come forward, more selection committees to choose women and more members of the electorate to vote for them. 6.55 pm
