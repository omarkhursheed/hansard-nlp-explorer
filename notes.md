  1. Speech #1 (1920, Astor/Murray): Gender misattribution - actually Mr. Murray speaking AGAINST lowering
  women's voting age. Classification CORRECT, gender WRONG.
  2. Speech #2 (1931, Miss Rathbone): About university representation, NOT suffrage. FALSE POSITIVE
  3. Speech #3 (1933, Miss Horsbrugh): Very brief statement "In France, as yet, there are not votes for women" -
   just stating a fact, not taking a stance. FALSE POSITIVE (or ambiguous at best, low confidence 0.45)
  4. Speech #4 (1935, Mrs. Runge): About voting rights for women in India - explicitly opposing an amendment for
   women's suffrage. LEGITIMATE
  5. Speech #5 (2001, Virginia Bottomley): About MP candidate shortlists, NOT voting rights. FALSE POSITIVE
