HC Deb 17 June 1912 vol 39 cc1325-435 1325 § The PRESIDENT of the BOARD of EDUCATION (Mr. J. A. Pease) I beg to move, "That leave be given to introduce a 1326 Bill to amend the law with respect to the Parliamentary and Local Government Franchises and the Registration of Parliamentary and Local Government Electors and to provide for the abolition of University Constituencies." 4.0 P.M. The Bill which I ask the leave of the House to introduce will not, I trust, arouse that vehement opposition which the other two principal measures of His Majesty's Government have evoked. At any rate, I think I may claim for this Bill that it will not offend the sentiment nor will it offend the religious convictions of any individual in the House. If hon. Members are anxious to criticise the details of the Bill, I, at any rate, hope that they will be prepared to accept the principles of the Bill, and will not regard these principles as controversial. The reform of our franchise and of our registration laws is a matter which has been constantly before the electors of the country, and during the last twenty-one years I suppose there has not been a single Member of the House sitting now on this side who has not at every election advocated the reform of both our franchise laws as well as of our registration system. Our present registration system is based upon eleven different Parliamentary franchises, with at least nineteen variations of different kinds. No one knows, excepting a few electioneering experts in the country, when he may become qualified, or how he is going to become qualified, whilst we all must feel that a matter of this kind ought to be outside the sphere of doubt and that the privilege...

Jessel. ] § Which Amendment to the proposed Amendment was after the word "shall," to insert the words "except in boroughs entitled on a basis of population to return three or more members."—[ Major Newman. ] § Question again proposed, "That those words be there inserted in the proposed Amendment."

Member for North Somerset (Mr. King) (in Sub-section (1) after the word "she" to insert "(a)") is not a substantive Amendment. I see his purpose, and if he succeeds with his subsequent Amendment, the necessary lettering will be done when the Bill is reprinted. § Mr. PETO I beg to move, in Subsection (1), to leave out the words "has attained the age of thirty years, and." The decision arrived at by the House yesterday was that some women, at any rate, should be admitted to the register of Parliamentary voters.

HL Deb 23 January 1918 vol 27 cc1020-148 1020 § Order of the day read for the House to be again into Committee. § Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.—( Viscount Peel. ) LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH My Lords, I think that it may be convenient to the House if, upon this Motion, I give a notice, though I admit that it refers to a future stage of the Bill. The House will recollect that the noble Earl the Lord President of the Council, in his speech yesterday on the large subject of proportional representation, on the Amendment then before the House, laid great stress at the end upon the inconvenience that would 1021 be caused by the delay involved in changing the Schedules. It would have been easy enough to say several things upon the merits of that. In the first place, although I do not want to go back to recriminations regarding the past, if the advice given by some of us in this House some months ago had been taken, that delay would have been greatly minimised because Schedules might have been ready even now. It is beyond all question the duty of everybody concerned to do everything that is possible to diminish any delay that may be caused. We none of us, I think, want to delay the Bill, and certainly we do not want to put any undue difficulties in the way of its operation. Therefore the practical thing for us is to see what we can do to avoid delay in the hope that the policy adopted by the House yesterday will be carried into effect. On behalf of some of those who are keenly in favour of the change adopted by the House yesterday, I beg to give notice...

For the purposes of this subsection the administrative county of London shall be treated as a parliamentary borough. § (3) The expression "business premises" in this section means land or other premises of the yearly value of not less than ten pounds occupied for the purpose of the business profession or trade of the person to be registered. § LORD FARRER moved, at the beginning of subsection (1), after "A man." to insert "including any Peer."

This Bill comes before us in a somewhat strange fashion, and I hope that the noble Earl opposite, the Leader of the House—who in his extremely able and lucid speech explained to us exactly what the attitude of the Government was upon it—will excuse me if I venture to repeat what he said to the House on that occasion. He said that this Bill was not a Government Bill in the ordinary sense of the term, a Bill upon which the fate of the Government depends, and he went on— All that the present Government assumed was the responsibility of giving legislative form to the Resolutions of the Speaker's Conference, and, further, of placing a Minister in general charge of the Bill. Well, that...

HC Deb 29 March 1928 vol 215 cc1359-481 1359 § Order for Second Reading read. § The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Sir William Joynson-Hicks) I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." This Bill, which fulfils, I think, what has been now for many years the aim of most parties in the House, including the Conservative party, is the logical conclusion of a series of Reform Bills, beginning with that of 1832. Although it is quite true that the Conservative party, prior to 1832, opposed the extension of Parliamentary reform, since 1832 it has joined with the other parties in the various extensions of the franchise which have been put before Parliament. Up to the year 1832, the system of Parliamentary representation had remained practically unchanged for four centuries, but, the Act of that year, and the Acts of 1867, 1884 and 1918 effected various reforms, with which I shall deal in a few minutes; and now I have the privilege to move what I hope will probably be the final reform, which will have the effect of giving to the people of our country greater and freer Parliamentary representation than in any other democratic country in the world. The old idea of Parliament was that it should represent—I am speaking now of the period before 1832 and about that time—that Members of Parliament represented organised communities of men who had more or less similar interests in particular constituencies. From that time onwards it began to be realised that a Member of Parliament was not merely the representative of a few gentlemen in a constituency, but that he had gradually become more and more representative of the great and very often unorganised masses of the people of the constituency. In 1867, when...

HC Deb 18 April 1928 vol 216 cc221-86 221 § Sir ALEXANDER SPROT I beg to move, in page 1, line 17, after the word "full," to insert the word electoral." I am very pleased to find that the Amendment I have put down collies within your description of order. It deals with what I regard as a very interesting point and one which has been debated a good deal outside this House. I should like at the start to say that I am quite friendly to the principle of this Bill. I voted for the Second Reading of the Bill, because I have always recognised that the inequality which remained in consequence of the restrictions put on the women's vote in 1918 could not permanently be maintained. I am not against the leading principles of the Bill at all, and I only seek to try to improve the provisions of the Measure. In order that my Amendment may be quite clear, I should like to read the Amendment which I propose, and also a new Clause which comes afterwards, and which explains it. Just now I am moving to insert the word "electoral." On page 312 hon. Members will find a new Clause standing in my name and that of other hon. Members and reading as follows: A person, for the purposes of this Act, shall be deemed to be of full electoral age when he or she has attained the age of twenty-five years, or if he is a person whose name has appeared on the, register of voters for any constituency prior to the passing of this Act. It will be seen that I am not proposing to disfranchise anybody, not proposing to deprive any person of his vote. When, subsequently, we come to the new Clause...

HC Deb 28 March 1928 vol 215 cc1248-314 1248 § Mr. WIGGINS I beg to move, That this House considers the present method of Parliamentary election unsatisfactory, and is of the opinion that such changes in the electoral machinery of the country should be made as will enable the political opinions of the voters to be reflected in the composition of the House of Commons. It is a curious coincidence that the two Members who managed to win first and second places in the ballot have put down for consideration questions of voting and the franchise and that to-morrow we are considering the question of the franchise once more. The necessity for a thorough examination into the method of parliamentary elections becomes, in my opinion, more pressing every day. A remark was made by a right hon. Gentleman recently that, while he was not prepared 1249 to enter into a controversy as to whether there will be more than three parties in the future, his own view was that there will only be two, the Conservative party and the Socialists. I think he said the Liberal party will disappear. Notwithstanding this forecast, which was made just before the result of the last two by-elections, I am definitely of opinion that at any rate for many years we are to have at least three and perhaps four parties contending for office and power. Speaking for the Liberal party, I aver most solemnly that we are neither dead nor dying. Rather we are growing in virility, in numbers, arid in importance every day and day by day. We are even overflowing our allotted space in this House. I am prepared to take the average of any party in the House. The country itself recognises that we are an indispensable part of the...

HC Deb 29 February 1924 vol 170 cc859-944 859 § Order for Second Reading read. Mr. W. M. ADAMSON I beg to Move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." In moving the Second Reading of this Measure, I fully realise the honour which the fortune of the ballot has bestowed upon me. I know that the Press has named this Bill a Leap Year proposal, owing, I suppose, to the fact that it is being introduced upon this, the 29th day of February. I rather think, however, that, if it had been a Leap Year proposal, probably one of the lady Members of the House would have been in the fortunate position of putting it forward. It is not within my function to-day to go into any great detail with regard to the proposals contained in the Bill, but I want very briefly to survey the ground that they cover, and to deal with one or two points that arise in connection with them. The first, and the most important, probably, is the conferring of the franchise on women 21 years of age. The second is the basing of the qualification for the franchise solely upon residence, except in the case of the university franchise. The third point is the assimilation of the local government and the Parliamentary franchises. Clause 4 of the Bill is intended to deal with the abolition of that portion of the 1918 Act which imposes a registration fee in connection with the university franchise, and Clause 7 is an addendum to Section 10 of the principal Act, to remove certain disqualifications that apply to local guardians and district councils. These are briefly the provisions of the Bill which we are proposing for Second Reading to-day. The first great point is, as I...

HC Deb 15 November 1917 vol 99 cc683-730 683 § (1) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a constituency (other than a university constituency) if she— (a) has attained the age of thirty years; and (b) is not subject to any legal incapacity; and (c) is entitled to be registered as a local government elector in respect of the occupation of land or premises in that constituency, or is the wife of a husband entitled to be so registered. § (2) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a university constituency if she has attained the age of thirty years and would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man. 684 § (3) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector for any local government electoral area where she would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man: Provided that a husband and wife shall not both be qualified as local government electors in respect of the same property. § Major HUNT I beg to move, in Subsection (1), to leave out from the word "elector"["registered as a Parliamentary elector"] to the end of the Subsection, and to insert instead thereof the words, "and to vote for any constituency in which she was born if she is nineteen years of age or over and is serving or has served outside the United Kingdom during this War under the Admiralty or War Office, and this shall be the only qualification necessary in these cases, and this right to vote shall continue for life." I move this Amendment because I think that the women who go abroad in this War to serve their country ought to have the...
