HC Deb 29 March 1928 vol 215 cc1359-481 1359 § Order for Second Reading read. § The SECRETARY of STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Sir William Joynson-Hicks) I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." This Bill, which fulfils, I think, what has been now for many years the aim of most parties in the House, including the Conservative party, is the logical conclusion of a series of Reform Bills, beginning with that of 1832. Although it is quite true that the Conservative party, prior to 1832, opposed the extension of Parliamentary reform, since 1832 it has joined with the other parties in the various extensions of the franchise which have been put before Parliament. Up to the year 1832, the system of Parliamentary representation had remained practically unchanged for four centuries, but, the Act of that year, and the Acts of 1867, 1884 and 1918 effected various reforms, with which I shall deal in a few minutes; and now I have the privilege to move what I hope will probably be the final reform, which will have the effect of giving to the people of our country greater and freer Parliamentary representation than in any other democratic country in the world. The old idea of Parliament was that it should represent—I am speaking now of the period before 1832 and about that time—that Members of Parliament represented organised communities of men who had more or less similar interests in particular constituencies. From that time onwards it began to be realised that a Member of Parliament was not merely the representative of a few gentlemen in a constituency, but that he had gradually become more and more representative of the great and very often unorganised masses of the people of the constituency. In 1867, when the great extension of the Parliamentary franchise took place, Lord Beaconsfield—or Mr. Disraeli, as he then was—used some words in this House which I want to quote to-day, and which I want to adopt as the reason for this Bill. He said: In the present age, and under the existing circumstances of the country, the best 1360 way to maintain and strengthen the character and functions of the House of Commons was to establish them on a broad, popular basis. That, I know, was agreed to and was the policy of the Liberal party at that time, and it was the policy of the Conservative party; and from then onwards both parties have, I will not say vied one with the other, but have taken their share in establishing Parliament on a broad and popular basis. [ Interruption. ] The hon. Member is good enough to make remarks of that kind. I am seeking to prove that from a mere historical position the Bill I am putting before the House is the logical outcome and the logical necessity of the various acts of politicians on both sides which have gradually led Parliament up to the position in which it is...

HC Deb 29 February 1924 vol 170 cc859-944 859 § Order for Second Reading read. Mr. W. M. ADAMSON I beg to Move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." In moving the Second Reading of this Measure, I fully realise the honour which the fortune of the ballot has bestowed upon me. I know that the Press has named this Bill a Leap Year proposal, owing, I suppose, to the fact that it is being introduced upon this, the 29th day of February. I rather think, however, that, if it had been a Leap Year proposal, probably one of the lady Members of the House would have been in the fortunate position of putting it forward. It is not within my function to-day to go into any great detail with regard to the proposals contained in the Bill, but I want very briefly to survey the ground that they cover, and to deal with one or two points that arise in connection with them. The first, and the most important, probably, is the conferring of the franchise on women 21 years of age. The second is the basing of the qualification for the franchise solely upon residence, except in the case of the university franchise. The third point is the assimilation of the local government and the Parliamentary franchises. Clause 4 of the Bill is intended to deal with the abolition of that portion of the 1918 Act which imposes a registration fee in connection with the university franchise, and Clause 7 is an addendum to Section 10 of the principal Act, to remove certain disqualifications that apply to local guardians and district councils. These are briefly the provisions of the Bill which we are proposing for Second Reading to-day. The first great point is, as I have already said, that of conferring the franchise upon women 21 years of age, as in the case of men to-day; and I wonder if, after the experience of the last ten years, there can be an hon. Member of this House who is prepared to put forward a logical argument to show why there should be a difference in the franchise of women as compared with that of men. So far as I can recollect, during 860 the period of the old franchise agitation, the only argument logically put against that extension then was that women were not entitled to the franchise until they were able to rear a race of men that was prepared to confer it upon them. We have overcome that difficulty, and the only question now is as to whether women are entitled to the franchise on the same grounds, under the same conditions, and at the same age as men are entitled to and exercise the franchise to-day. I would remind the House that on previous occasions within recent years Measures of this kind have been before it. In 1919, a Measure for the complete citizenship of women on the same terms as men...

HC Deb 28 March 1912 vol 36 cc615-731 615 § Order for Second Reading read. § Mr. AGG-GARDNER I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a second time." I am sorry that this responsible and important duty has not been placed in abler hands, but I trust that my shortcomings will be forgiven, and that they will not be allowed in any way to prejudice the measure which I am recommending to the House. Whatever objections there may be to this Bill, I think I may fairly claim for it a merit of simplicity. It consists of only two Clauses, one declaring the principle of the Bill and the other defining the scope of its operations. The principle has already been affirmed by the House, and on the latest occasion, last Session, it was carried by a majority of nearly three to one. But the inexorable destiny which in our days dominates the legislation of private Members prevented further progress. Since then, however, we have had the promise of the Prime Minister, to whose courtesy we are indebted for the opportunity of discussing—the promoters of the Bill desire to express every thanks, that if the Bill again obtains a Second Reading with an adequate majority, facilities will be provided so as to enable the House to carry into effect its repeated decisions. I think it will be conceded that up to this point the prospects of the Bill were bright. I am bound to admit, however, that within the last few weeks the prospects have been dimmed and darkened by the deplorable conduct of certain persons, who, though hostile to the Bill, are credited with a desire to obtain its object—the enfranchisement of women. The tactics of these individuals, a systematic interruption of meetings, personal insults to Cabinet Ministers, and the wanton destruction of private property, are to me absolutely repellant, and I believe this feeling is shared by most of the supporters of the Bill. But I do not wish to join in heaping reproaches on those who are now suffering, and suffering severely, for their errors. I prefer to regard them as the victims of a probably well-intentioned and perhaps earnest, but certainly misguided enthusiasm. All I can say, so far as our Bill is concerned, is that they have shown the truth of the German maxim, "Enthusiasts without reason are the really dangerous people." Though, however, 616 these tactics have naturally shocked public sentiment and alienated public sympathy, I hope they will not be allowed to alienate the vote of those in this House who have hitherto supported the objects of the Bill. For what we have to consider and to decide upon is, not the conduct of individuals, but the merits or demerits of an important question of electoral reform. Individuals who are associated with this and kindred measures are, after all, but transient beings, here to-day and gone to-morrow. The great principles, such as justice and freedom, on which we claim to...

HC Deb 20 June 1917 vol 94 cc1811-911 1811 § (1) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a constituency (other than a university constituency) if she has attained the age of thirty years, and is entitled to be registered as a local government elector in respect of land or premises in that constituency, or is the wife of a husband entitled to be so registered. § (2) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a university constituency if she has attained the age of thirty years and would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man. 1812 § (3) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector for any local government electoral area where she would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man: Provided that a husband and wife shall not both be qualified as local government electors in respect of the same property. § The CHAIRMAN The first Amendment on the Paper in the name of the hon. Member for North Somerset (Mr. King) (in Sub-section (1) after the word "she" to insert "(a)") is not a substantive Amendment. I see his purpose, and if he succeeds with his subsequent Amendment, the necessary lettering will be done when the Bill is reprinted. § Mr. PETO I beg to move, in Subsection (1), to leave out the words "has attained the age of thirty years, and." The decision arrived at by the House yesterday was that some women, at any rate, should be admitted to the register of Parliamentary voters. The question now raised by the Amendment standing in my name and in the name of the Noble Lord the Member for Oxford University (Lord H. Cecil) raises the point as to who among these women are to have the vote and how many. It has always appeared to me that to attempt to deal with numbers by proposing an age limit of thirty years is absolutely arbitrary and illogical, and I contend, as an opponent of the wholesale grant of votes to women, that it would be quite ineffective. At the Speaker's Conference every age from twenty-five to forty was suggested, and every age had certain adherents. I do not think it can be said that the age of thirty represents any considered and final judgment of any member of the Committee, apart from the question of what was suggested by the Speaker's Conference upstairs. I was glad to see the name of the Noble Lord the Member for Oxford University attached to my Amendment, because after very carefully perusing his speech of yesterday I see that he is strongly in favour of the granting of suffrage to women upon some terms and conditions, and no doubt the Committee will hear what terms and conditions he considers are the most appropriate. I notice that the Noble Lord the Member for Oxford University voted in...

First 500 words:
HC Deb 27 February 1920 vol 125 cc2067-144 2067 § Order for Second Heading read. § Mr. GRUNDY I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I feel it a very great honour and pleasure to move the second reading of this Bill, which is designed to amend the Representation of the People Act of 1918. It is to confer the franchise on women on exactly the same terms as it is given to men, first, by removing the age limit of thirty years and substituting the same age limit as applies to men, that is to say, twenty-one years. The Bill also seeks to secure equality between the sexes of all classes, first, by abolishing the occupational qualification and the qualification of women as the wives of local Government electors; and, secondly, by placing the whole franchise for both sexes for Parliament and local government bodies on the single basis of residence, with the exception of university electors. Clause 1 of the Bill repeals the first section of the 1918 Act and substitutes a general franchise for both Parliamentary and local government purposes for all women and men who have attained the age of twenty-one years, who are not subject to any legal incapacity, and have a requisite residence qualification. Clauses 2 and 3 are consequential amendments, following up the effect of Clause 1. The 1918 Act while it simplified the franchise in certain directions, also created certain anomalies. For instance, for the first time in the history of the franchise law a wider franchise for Parliament was established than for local government bodies, for the supreme authority, having the power of legislation, the 1918 Act provided a wider franchise than for the local authorities concerned only with administration. The effect of the restriction of the women's parliamentary vote to the age of thirty was to keep off the register the great mass of industrial working women It was claimed that the vote was given to women by the 1918 Act as a recognition of their industrial service during the War. I should place the recognition of the right of women to vote on an equality with men 2068 on a much higher plane than industrial work during the War. As an actual fact, only about one in fifteen of the industrial working women were enfranchised. The great mass of the factory and office workers among women are under thirty years of age, and many of those over thirty years of age have not the necessary local government qualifications under the 1918 Act. It is estimated that 90 per cent. of the women now on the register are wives in the homes of the country, and that single women are still largely disfranchised. The retention of the occupational qualification for local government affects the women adversely, as their Parliamentary vote depends on their husbands' local government qualification. The only way to clear up these anomalies and to settle the vexed question of lodgings and...

HC Deb 19 June 1917 vol 94 cc1633-756 1633 § (1) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a constituency (other than a university constituency) it' she has attained the age of thirty years, and is entitled to be registered as a local government elector in respect of land or premises in that constituency, or is the wife of a husband entitled to be so registered. § (2) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector for a university constituency if she has attained the age of thirty years and would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man. § (3) A woman shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector for any local government electoral area where she would be entitled to be so registered if she were a man: Provided that a husband and wife shall not both be qualified as local government electors in respect of the same property. § The CHAIRMAN Perhaps it will be for the convenience of hon. Members if I indicate at the beginning in which order it appears to me, subject to anything that hon. Members may have to submit to me, the principal points on this Clause are likely to arise. I will deal in a moment with the first Amendment on the Paper, on which I have something to say. Apart from that, I think the questions will arise in the following order. The first is the Amendment in the name of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the City of London (Sir F. Banbury). It will be noticed that his proposal to leave out Sub-sections (1) and (2) of the Clause is not in this case equivalent to the rejection of the Clause, and therefore he is entitled to raise that Amendment at an early point. That will decide, so far as the Committee is concerned, the question whether or not any women are to be entitled to be registered as Parliamentary electors. After that we shall come to the 1634 Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Peto) and the Noble Lord, the Member for Oxford University (Lord H. Cecil), which proposes that if any women are to be entitled to be registered, they should be registered on the same terms as men. Their Amendment is to leave out the reference to a special age of qualification. Thirdly, there will be an Amendment, if it is desired to move it, which I will save when putting the Amendment last referred to, in the name of the hon. Member for the Westhoughton Division (Mr. Tyson Wilson) to substitute the age of twenty-five for thirty, as it stands in the Clause. Fourthly, there will be the Amendment, again, of the two hon. Members, the hon. Member for Devizes and the Noble Lord the Member for Oxford University, to leave out the qualification for married women in respect of...

First 500 words:
HL Deb 21 May 1928 vol 71 cc160-206 160 § Order of the Day for the Second Reading read. § THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD HAILSHAM) My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I desire to state quite shortly the principle to which this Bill is designed to give effect, and the method by which we propose that that principle should be enacted, and, finally, to deal in a few sentences with one or two objections which have been raised to the Bill in its present form, leaving, of course, other matters which may be raised by your Lordships to be dealt with at the conclusion of the debate. The principle which this Bill proposes to pass into a Statute may, I think, be stated in a sentence in the language used by the Prime Minister at the time of the last General Election when the Prime Minister stated that it was the policy of the Unionist Party to give equal political rights to men and women. That, my Lords—equal political rights to men and women—is the principle which this Bill embodies. I have stated it in the language used by my right hon. friend and Leader, but it would be only fair that I should add that both the other political Parties, the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party equally embodied in their Election programmes the same political creed. We have therefore a principle to which all three political Parties have declared their allegiance. It ought not to require any lengthy argument to support its justice. Indeed, when this Bill was being 161 debated in another place I observed that upon the Second Reading, there were in the Division Lobbies, I will not say ten just men but just ten men who were found to register their opposition to it. It is easy in debate to discuss whether or not women should be admitted to the franchise equally with men, but when once that controversy has passed into the realm of history, as is has in our own country, it is, I think, much more difficult to find any logical ground for saying that women who are to be held entitled to the franchise shall yet be given it, by reason of their sex alone, on some more limited scope than men. The method which we propose to adopt can equally be stated fairly shortly. There were, presumably, three possible ways of enacting this principle. You could, first of all, enfranchise women on the same terms as men. Secondly, you could disfranchise men to the same extent as women. Thirdly, you could combine those two alternatives and disfranchise some men and enfranchise some women so as to bring the two sexes upon an equality. The course which we have selected is the first of those three. We are proposing to give to women the same franchise that men at present enjoy. Your Lordships will remember that at the same time that he originally declared this principle of...

Chamber: Commons

First 500 words:
HC Deb 23 October 1918 vol 110 cc785-857 785 § Mr. HERBERT SAMUEL I beg to move, "That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that a Bill be passed forthwith making women eligible as Members of Parliament." This Resolution is the natural consequence of the action taken by Parliament earlier this year in enacting the enfranchisement of women. It has now been decided that sex is not to be a bar for citizenship, and it follows from that, I suggest to the House, that sex ought not to be a bar against taking part in Parliamentary life. You cannot say that 814 6,000,000 women shall be voters, but that not one shall ever be a legislator. By our deliberate action in passing the Representation of the People Bill we have given up the old narrow doctrine that woman's sphere was the home and nothing but the home. We have given up the old theory that woman's interests were not on a level with man's interests, that woman, in fact, was nothing but an adjunct to man, or, as it has been well expressed, the doctrine which laid down that woman was not a noun but an adjective. That principle has been frankly surrendered, and I would suggest to hon. Members that the risks which have been faced in enacting that women may be elected to Parliament would be far less than those which were deliberately undertaken when we enacted the enfranchisement of women. For my own part, I have always been in favour of the principle of women's suffrage. I have held the view that the perfect State would include both men and women as its citizens. Life is on a two-sex basis. You cannot put politics only on a one-sex basis. But for many years I had doubts whether the degree of public interest which had been taken by women on the average made it safe at that time to enact a large measure of woman suffrage. The War, however, has brought great changes. It has made women familiar with many aspects of public life. It has drawn the attention of vast numbers of them to questions of industrial employment, of prices, of international politics, and of many matters on which previously they had held aloof. And many of us have been ready during the War to modify our previous view, and to join in the enfranchisement of women. To those, however, who are still doubtful as to the wisdom of the enfranchisement of women and to those who think we have taken, as undoubtedly we have, considerable risks in adding this vast new electorate to citizenship, I submit this argument, that when you deal with enfranchisement you cannot discriminate. You deal with a class in the mass. You have to take into account the capacities of the average person. But when you deal with representation you are not dealing with the average woman. You are dealing with the exceptional woman, and you have to take...

HC Deb 04 July 1919 vol 117 cc1283-345 1283 § Not amended (in the Standing Committee), considered. § Motion made, and Question proposed, That the Bill be now read the third time. § The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of HEALTH (Major Astor) I beg to move, to leave out the word "now,'' and, at the end of the Question, to add the words, "upon this day three months. I am here in the absence of my right hon. Friend the President of the Local Government Board, because in the past the Local Government Board has dealt with questions of registration. I consulted Mr. Speaker just now as to the best manner in which I could state the policy of the Government. The Government have decided that, on the whole, it will be preferable not to attempt to amend this Bill, but to introduce their own Bill, probably next week, to redeem their election pledges. The Government election pledges, as the House probably knows, are to give equality in civil and judicial matters to women as compared with men. Hon. Members here will realise and appreciate the great work which has been done by women, and will welcome this recognition which is made officially by the Government in the announcement that they will take an early opportunity to establish full equality in civil and judicial matters as between men and women. The Government have decided that it would be better to give effect to this by bringing in their own measure: for two reasons. The first is a question of draftsmanship. I have been through Clause 1, which deals with civil and judicial offices, with the Parliamentary draftsman, and, in our opinion, it would be far better to give effect to the intention of the framers of the Clause by moving it in a different manner. For instance, we propose to begin that Clause with the words "A person," instead of "A woman." That is to say, we propose to remove inequalities not only from women, but from men so far as they exist. The Bill which we shall introduce shortly will enable all persons, including women, to hold civil and judicial posts, to enter and exorcise any civil professions in the future. That is to say, it will be very wide and 1284 comprehensive, and, in our opinion, will be better drafted than the present Bill. For instance, I understand that there is considerable doubt as to the meaning of the words, under any authority or body corporate or un-incorporate deriving powers directly or indirectly from any Act of Parliament, Order in Council, charter or franchise whatsoever. That appears to refer to some sort of quasi-official body, and we believe that the Clause, as drafted by the Government, will make the purpose quite clear. We do not propose to deal with the question of ecclesiastical equality. That may be raised in discussion on the Bill. I am giving a general indication of what will be in the Bill. There...

HC Deb 05 May 1911 vol 25 cc738-809 738 § Order for Second Reading read. § Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Bill be now read a second time." § Sir GEORGE KEMP I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill, which differs in two points from that read a second time by this House last year —first in point of title, and second in the fact that the £10 qualification has been omitted. The title has been so altered now as to admit of free amendment. It is quite true that it has not been so amended as to admit of the inclusion of more men than are already enfranchised; but that is not the object of the Bill, and it was not for that purpose that the Prime Minister gave his pledge that facilities should be given during the present Parliament for effectively proceeding with the measure. The £10 qualification has been omitted in order to meet the objections of those who felt that under it there might be an increase of plural or faggot voting. Both those two alterations have been made to meet the objections of avowed supporters of Woman Suffrage. The object of the Bill is to remove once and all the bar of sex so far as the Parliamentary franchise is concerned. During the discussion last year on that Bill the Prime Minister said that he did not understand on what principle the Bill was framed. This Bill has been framed on what appears to me a clear principle—to give the franchise to women who are householders. Those who are connected with the framing of the Bill thought that that was a satisfactory line on which to proceed, because the household qualification is one which has not been in debate between various parties in this House. And it was felt that the householder had some right to consideration if the head of the household was a woman, because she has to deal with the daily difficulties of the household, she comes into touch with the rough and tumble of the world, she is responsible for carrying on the household, and she is responsible for the rates and taxes in respect of the house. She has, in fact, to deal with the problems of life. This is a non-party Bill. In it an. attempt has been made to meet the views of all parties in the House. The Liberal and Labour parties were anxious that in any Bill to give the franchise to women no special advantage should be given 739 to the propertied classes. They were anxious, as also were many Members on the other side of the House, to have a democratic Bill. Those who are responsible for this Bill believe that it is a democratic Bill. They have obtained figures, which I believe have been put before every Member of the House, showing exactly how many women of each class in the country would be enfranchised. They took Dundee,...

First 500 words:
HC Deb 17 June 1912 vol 39 cc1325-435 1325 § The PRESIDENT of the BOARD of EDUCATION (Mr. J. A. Pease) I beg to move, "That leave be given to introduce a 1326 Bill to amend the law with respect to the Parliamentary and Local Government Franchises and the Registration of Parliamentary and Local Government Electors and to provide for the abolition of University Constituencies." 4.0 P.M. The Bill which I ask the leave of the House to introduce will not, I trust, arouse that vehement opposition which the other two principal measures of His Majesty's Government have evoked. At any rate, I think I may claim for this Bill that it will not offend the sentiment nor will it offend the religious convictions of any individual in the House. If hon. Members are anxious to criticise the details of the Bill, I, at any rate, hope that they will be prepared to accept the principles of the Bill, and will not regard these principles as controversial. The reform of our franchise and of our registration laws is a matter which has been constantly before the electors of the country, and during the last twenty-one years I suppose there has not been a single Member of the House sitting now on this side who has not at every election advocated the reform of both our franchise laws as well as of our registration system. Our present registration system is based upon eleven different Parliamentary franchises, with at least nineteen variations of different kinds. No one knows, excepting a few electioneering experts in the country, when he may become qualified, or how he is going to become qualified, whilst we all must feel that a matter of this kind ought to be outside the sphere of doubt and that the privilege should be obtained in the simplest possible manner. The intricacy of our franchise laws is without parallel in the history of the civilised world. The registration system is a complex growth due to the antiquated character of some of our franchise Acts, and to the fact that a large number of electoral anomalies have been created by the overlapping of enfranchising Acts from time to time, and the matter at the present moment is wrapped in utter confusion. We have in front of us a large number of great social problems to solve. We see around us a considerable amount of labour unrest in the country, and there ought to be no doubt in the mind of anyone as to the truly representative character of the House of Commons. There ought to be no room for any suspicion that some interests are over-represented or that others are under-represented. If any suspicion does exist in any 1327 quarter we may be quite sure that it begets dissatisfaction and that it has a "weakening effect upon the confidence which is placed in the authority of Parliament.

HC Deb 30 April 1913 vol 52 cc1220-85 1220 § Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Bill be now read a second time." § Mr. STAVELEY-HILL I desire to ask your ruling, Mr. Speaker, upon the point as to whether the contents of this Bill do not go beyond the Title of the Bill? You will remember that on 8th April leave was given to introduce the Bill in these words: "to impose a penalty on an elector who votes in more than one constituency at a General Parliamentary Election." The title of the Bill repeats those words, but when one comes to look at the Bill itself, at Clause 1, Sub-Clause (1), one finds that it imposes a penalty upon a person who votes or asks for a Parliamentary paper for that purpose in more than one constituency at a General Parliamentary Election. I need not argue that the words "person" and "elector" are in a sense very widely different. "Person" must have a much wider application; for that reason alone I submit that the Bill goes beyond the scope of the measure for which leave was given, but if one refers to the Plural Voting Bill , introduced into this House in 1906 by the right hon. Gentleman who is now Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Harcourt), one finds that in that Bill as amended the first sentence runs, "Persons registered as Parliamentary electors," and so on. The qualifying words are "registered as Parliamentary Electors." If these words were in this Bill after the word "person," of course I should not wish to ask your ruling upon this matter, but, as the Bill is, I submit that the absence of those qualifying words gives 1221 the contents a much wider applicaton than was intended when leave was given to introduce the Bill. There is only this other point, that "a person," whether an elector or not, can vote or can ask for a ballot paper for the purpose of voting, but of course he is liable, if not an elector, to penalties for personation, but at the same "a person" can do that, and it is introducing to my mind words altogether outside the scope of the Bill and beyond its Title. § Mr. SPEAKER The hon. Member suggests that the words "a person" are not the same as "an elector." On that ground, he asks me to rule that the Bill cannot proceed any further. But it appears to me that even if he is right in supposing that the intention of the promoters of this Bill in introducing the word "person" was to extend it, it would still be open in Committee to insert the words "qualified to vote as an elector" or to omit the word "person" and insert "elector," and therefore it would be perfectly easy, by making a small correction, to bring it into accord with the measure for the introduction of which leave was given. I do not know...

I think that my Amendment really deals with a substantial defect in the Bill. On Thursday last your 530 Lordships passed a provision in Clause 4 that "a woman shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector if she is the wife of a husband entitled to be so registered as a local government elector." § THE EARL OF SELBORNE Before the noble Lord comes to that, I want to ask the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill two questions about paragraph ( c ), subsection (1). Might not the effect of paragraph ( c ) be to deprive of a vote the wife of a certain class of soldier? I will take the sergeant-major, the colour-sergeant, and the sergeants of a Regular regiment in normal times. They would have married quarters, and I presume they would not be local government electors. If so, their wives would not get the vote. I think your Lordships will agree that, if any...

There is no ques- 466 tion whatever that the proposal here made is one of a very momentous character. I think that speakers on both sides have agreed in taking that view with regard to it and to its possible effects. One reason that is advanced in support of the proposal as it stands in the Bill is that it comes to us with the authority of the Speaker's Conference. That is perfectly true. But I very much doubt whether the same weight should be attached to that proposal of the Speaker's Conference as rightly attaches to other proposals relating to other matters in the Bill. And for more than one reason. In the first place, all the other points were, we understand, settled either unanimously or with a very great preponderance of opinion among the members of the Conference in favour of the recommendations embodied in the Bill, which now come before your Lordships' House in the other portions of the Bill relating to other matters than votes for women. Moreover, I think that your Lordships, on looking at the other proposals of the Bill which form the subject of discussion to a certain extent,...

For the purposes of this subsection the administrative county of London shall be treated as a parliamentary borough. § (3) The expression "business premises" in this section means land or other premises of the yearly value of not less than ten pounds occupied for the purpose of the business profession or trade of the person to be registered. § LORD FARRER moved, at the beginning of subsection (1), after "A man." to insert "including any Peer." The noble Lord said: I have put down this Amendment at this late stage because during the deeply interesting debates which have occurred in your Lordships' House certain definite points have emerged which were not clear at their inception. The noble Viscount in charge of the Bill, in Committee, ill answer to a question of mine, stated that the disability of a Peer to vote for a Member of the other House rested upon Common Law, not upon any Statute. I notice that at the recent meeting of the Judges with the Lord Chief Justice starting on his Mission to America the Lord Chief Justice was defined as "the custodian of the Common Law." I hope I may therefore find in him some sympathy with our 1177 potential disabilities, even though he be in another land. Moreover, the Lord Chancellor has told us during our debates that— The whole policy of the Bill is that residence in the constituency, even though not as a matter of right but on sufferance, shall be enough to confer the right to vote. If so, and this be really the democratic country which we have so frequently during these debates been assured that it is, there ought not, I think, to be one special class...

First 500 words:
HC Deb 04 April 1919 vol 114 cc1561-627 1561 § Order for Second Beading read. § Mr. ADAMSON I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a second time. In the absence of my hon. Friend (Mr. Spoor), it is my privilege to move the Second Reading of the Bill which stands in his name and in the names of certain others of my hon. Friends. It is a small Bill, and provides for the removal of certain restraints and disabilities which are still imposed upon women. Clause 1 of the Bill seeks to remove the disqualification that stands against women holding civil and judicial appointments. Clause 2 seeks to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1918 , in a manner that will place women upon an equal footing with men, and Clause 3 seeks to remove the disqualifications which prevent them from sitting and voting in the House of Lords on the same footing as they are now entitled to sit and vote in the House of Commons. The Bill would, if placed on the Statute Book, give in a considerable degree effect to the political and legal equality of men and women. The introduction of it by the Labour party is simply the natural sequence of all our past work and past efforts on behalf of the enfranchisement of the women of the country. We have always contended that in order to give fair and equitable treatment to our women folk it was essential that the existing restraints and disabilities should be removed. In the closing days of the last Parliament, when we were discussing by Resolution the desirability of passing a Bill forthwith making women eligible as Members of Parliament, the Noble Lord the Member for Hitchin (Lord R. Cecil) said in the course of the discussion: I should have liked, I confess, to have seen this Resolution go much further and sweep away all the disqualifications which at present prevent women from competing on equal terms with men even in my own profession."—[ OFFICIAL REPORT, 23rd October, 1918, col. 828, Vol. 110. ] I understand that within the last few days the question of the opening of the legal profession to women on equal terms with men has been under consideration in another place, and that the Government have promised to give sympathetic consideration to that proposal. The Bill 1562 which I am now introducing for the second time will, to a considerable extent, give the House the opportunity to-day of sweeping away these restraints and disabilities to which the Noble Lord referred on the occasion I have mentioned. Not only is it the policy of the Labour party to remove the disqualifications which prevent men and women competing on equal terms, but the Coalition Members of this House are also pledged to remove the existing inequalities in the law as between women and men, and the Liberal party also has adopted the principle contained in this Bill. Therefore, I am hopeful that...

First 500 words:
HC Deb 05 May 1922 vol 153 cc1713-58 1713 § Order for Second Reading read. § Lieut.-Colonel ARCHER-SHEE I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time." Not many of the provisions of the Bill are controversial. [ Laughter. ] If I may say so to hon. Members opposite who laugh, I think there are only two Clauses which have the slightest tinge of controversy about them. I know that Clauses 2 and 3 will not appeal to hon. Members opposite, but as regards the rest, of the Bill the Clauses are really only for the purpose of correcting anomalies and for introducing certain improvements in the Act of 1918, and subsequent Acts dealing with that Act. Clause 1 deals with quite a small point, but one which is an anomaly, arising out of the Act of 1918. Under the Act of 1918, a woman is entitled to the Parliamentary vote if her husband is entitled to the local government vote. There are cases where, owing to that entitlement, a woman has the Parliamentary vote and her husband, from whom she gets that vote, is not entitled to be a Parliamentary elector. The object of this Clause is to put that right, and to provide that where a woman has the Parliamentary vote owing to her husband having been qualified as a local government elector though not as a Parliamentary elector, he should become entitled to the Parliamentary vote. Clause 2 deals with the further disqualification of conscientious objectors. In the principal Act of 1918 the House made a law by which conscientious objectors were to be disqualified for five years after the War. As things have turned out, that would practically only disqualify them for one General Election, and, in view of the fact that their failure to assist their country at the time of its dire peril and distress was really in the nature of a crime against the State, I consider that the disqualification should be increased for another five years so as to disqualify them for probably one or two more General Elections. This would 1714 only refer to those persons who were disqualified under the special provisions of the Act of 1918. Clause 3 deals with aliens who have become naturalised in this country. There is nothing in the Act of 1918 to prevent aliens from voting directly after naturalisation. The War showed that men had come over here from Germany and other countries and, with their tongues in their teeth, so to speak, had got British citizenship after five years' qualification. The strain of War showed that the real allegiance of those men—it was quite natural—was to their own Fatherland of Germany, or some other Continental country. That shows that it is not safe, after you have naturalised a man, to allow him to have full voting power, and stand for Parliament, until he has been, at any rate, through a probationary period. The proposal in Clause 3 is that...

HL Deb 17 July 1924 vol 58 cc696-711 696 § Order of the Day for the Second Reading read. LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE My Lords, may I rise to a point of order of which I have given private notice to the noble Viscount who is in charge of this Bill? The point of order is this: I submit that the Bill which the noble Viscount proposes to read a second time deals entirely with the Prerogative of the Crown, and therefore can only be considered by the House if introduced by a Minister of the Crown. Your Lordships are all aware of the form which the Patents we so often hear read at the Table take. His Majesty confers a certain title of "His special Grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion," and there are limitations to every honour which he confers. In most cases it is conferred upon an individual with remainder to his heirs male, and those heirs male are given a right to a seat and voice in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In some cases there is remainder to the daughter of the person, and in that case the Patent specially omits to confer on that lady the right to a seat and voice in Parliament. May I read to your Lordships the Patent conferred recently on the late Lord Rhondda? It confers upon him the state, degree, style, dignity, title and honour of Viscount Rhondda of Llanwerth, with remainder to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten and to be begotten, and in default of such issue remainder is given to his daughter Margaret Haig Mackworth, who is to have and to hold the name, state, degree, style, dignity, title and honour of Viscountess Rhondda of Llanwerth. The patent proceeds:— … willing and by these Presents granting for Us Our heirs and successors 697 that the said David Alfred Baron Rhondda and his heirs male aforesaid and in default of such issue the heirs male of the said Margaret Haig Mackworth and every of them successively and respectively may have hold and possess a seat, place and voice in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As your Lordships will see the lady is omitted. I submit that this Bill is an attempt to deal with the Prerogative of the Crown, and I should like to know whether, in the opinion of the House, it has not been the habit in the past, to deal with such matters only when the measure is introduced by a Minister of the Crown. I believe it has been nearly always the custom when dealing with the reform of this House to deal with it first by Resolution, and I believe that was the case when Lord Lansdowne introduced a series of Resolution". I therefore desire to put this point of order. § VISCOUNT CECIL OF CHELWOOD My Lords, on the point of order I should like to say just one word, if I may be allowed to...

HL Deb 22 May 1928 vol 71 cc213-56 213 § Debate resumed (according to Order) on the Amendment, moved yesterday by Lord Banbury of Southam, to the Motion for the Second Reading—namely, That the Bill be read 2 a this day six months. § THE EARL OF MIDLETON My Lords, I think most of your Lordships, who listened to the whole of the discussion last night, will have felt that in the trenchant speeches delivered by several members of this House points were made that even the lucid statement of the Lord Chancellor does not entirely cover. Certainly attention was drawn to the very peculiar position in which this Bill stands, and I think we have a right to ask what are the credentials under which the Bill is brought before us. The Prime Minister some time ago delivered an obiter dictum as to the desirability of equalising the franchise of the two sexes—an obiter dictum to which members of this House, who were impressed by the way in which women discharged their duties under the franchise obtained in 1918, were quite willing to subscribe—but 214 the Prime Minister coupled that pledge with a distinct undertaking that the question should be examined as a whole by a Conference, which Conference, he suggested, would be best presided over by the Speaker of the House of Commons. It was pointed out last night by, among others, Lord de Clifford, who spoke for the first time, with great force, that the fact that the Speaker in his peculiar position did not find it possible to preside over a Conference, did not in any way cut away the necessity for some consideration before taking this extraordinary plunge. Look back to the Reform Bills. Surely, when the Prime Minister gave that pledge he must have had in his mind, not merely the immense excitement which attended the Reform Bills of 1832, 1567 and 1884, but the fact that in 1918 the existing franchise was given in great haste after the War, mainly on the argument that it was not fair that the men who had fought in the War, and the women who had co-operated with them, should have no share in the discussions affecting the re-instatement of the country after peace. But I do not think anybody can maintain that the Bill of 1918 was marked by any considerable previous discussion, and it is unknown in our history that within ten years a further step should be taken without the least attempt made to weigh the effect of the last advance. Honestly I cannot think that the unanimity of opinion which is claimed for the introduction of the present Bill has any justification in fact. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack alluded somewhat humorously to the ten just men, or rather just ten men, who had gone into the Lobby against the Bill in the House of Commons. I would ask him whether in his experience or anybody else's he can remember...
