## Repository State

```
Status: PRODUCTION READY
Health: EXCELLENT
Tests: ALL PASSING
Data: VALIDATED
Docs: COMPLETE
```

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. Always test with real data
2. Commit frequently (every major change)
3. Maintain test coverage above 80%
4. Document truth in data, not expectations

### For Analysis
1. Start with small samples (50-100 debates)
2. Use moderate filtering (level 3) by default
3. Verify results against raw data
4. Report actual patterns found

### For Maintenance
1. Run data validation weekly
2. Update tests when adding features
3. Keep archive organized
4. Maintain clear commit messages

## Conclusion

- ✓ Minimal, focused codebase
- ✓ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✓ Validated data integrity
- ✓ Working analysis pipeline
- ✓ Complete documentation

The repository is now pristine, well-tested, and ready for research use.
