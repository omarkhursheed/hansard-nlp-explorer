**Lines:** 621

### Gender Analysis Test (1995-1996, 1,000 speeches):

**Data Loaded:**
- 927 male speeches (from 49,888 available)
- 70 female speeches (from 3,826 available)
- Year-stratified sampling maintained distribution

**Analysis Results:**
- **Unigrams:** 11,064 unique male words, 3,362 unique female words
- **Bigrams:** 62,495 unique male, 7,034 unique female
- **Topics:** 8 topics each (LDA)
- **Gender Language:**
  - Male speeches: 2,273 male-gendered words, 357 female-gendered words
  - Female speeches: 206 male-gendered words, 86 female-gendered words
- **Filtering:** 63.5% word reduction (216,378 → 78,987 words)

**Key Findings:**
- Female MPs focus more on: "homeless", "children", "housing", "asylum seekers", "breast cancer"
- Male MPs focus more on: "labour party", "european union", "armed forces", "manufacturing"
- Female bigrams reveal social policy focus: "homeless people", "asylum seekers", "children act"
- Male bigrams reveal institutional/international focus: "labour party", "united kingdom", "armed forces"

### Overall Corpus Test (1990-1991, 100 debates):

**Data Loaded:**
- 99 debates (from 13,251 available)
- Stratified across 2 years

**Analysis Results:**
- **Unigrams:** 10,442 unique words (moderate filtering)
- **Bigrams:** 72,998 unique bigrams
- **Filtering stats calculated correctly** for all 5 levels

### Filtering Comparison Test:

✅ Ran all 5 filtering levels automatically
✅ Generated comparison visualization
✅ Filtering effectiveness clearly visualized:

| Level | Original Words | Filtered Words | Reduction |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| minimal | 235,471 | 178,253 | 24.3% |

## Code Reduction Achieved

**Old System:**
- `enhanced_gender_corpus_analysis.py`: 904 lines
- `comprehensive_corpus_analysis.py`: 752 lines
- `hansard_nlp_analysis.py`: 1,067 lines
- **Total:** 2,723 lines (with duplicate code)

**New System:**
- `unified_text_filtering.py`: 350 lines
- `unified_corpus_loader.py`: 250 lines
- `unified_visualizations.py`: +342 lines (extension)
- `corpus_analysis.py`: 621 lines
- **Total:** 1,563 lines (no duplication)

**Reduction:** 43% less code, 100% more consistent

## Performance

### Gender Analysis (1,000 speeches):
- Loading: ~3 seconds
- Analysis: ~15 seconds
- Visualization: ~5 seconds
- **Total:** ~23 seconds

### Filtering Comparison (5 levels, 100 debates):
- 5 separate analyses: ~30 seconds
- Comparison visualization: ~2 seconds
- **Total:** ~32 seconds

---

## Quality Checks

### Visualizations:
✅ Professional color palette used throughout
✅ Consistent DPI (300 for saves, 150 for display)
✅ NO pie charts (using horizontal bar charts)
✅ NO word clouds (as per CLAUDE.md)
✅ White backgrounds
✅ Clean, minimal styling
✅ Publication-ready quality

### Data Processing:
✅ Year-stratified sampling maintains temporal distribution
✅ Policy terms preserved during filtering
✅ Bigram extraction consistent across all analyses
✅ Gender analysis working for both datasets
✅ Topic modeling produces meaningful results

### Code Quality:
✅ No arbitrary limits (e.g., `[:10]`) in production code
✅ All sample sizes controlled via command-line
✅ Consistent error handling
✅ Clear documentation
✅ Type hints where appropriate

---

## Known Issues

### Minor:
1. ⚠ Female sample sizes are small in some periods (reflects historical reality)
2. ⚠ Topic modeling for female MPs may fail with very small samples (handled gracefully)
3. ⚠ Some stop words like "would", "may", "one" still appear in top words (consider moving to aggressive filter)

### To Be Implemented:
- Overall corpus visualizations (currently placeholder)
- TF-IDF filtering mode (defined but not fully integrated)
- spaCy POS/NER filtering (requires spaCy installation)
