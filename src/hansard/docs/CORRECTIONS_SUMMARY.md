# Summary of Corrections to MP Matching Code

## Date: 2025-09-20

## User Directive
"Never invent tests that are incorrect, go back and look through your code for assumptions like this and fix them, also don't infer term of prime ministers, etc. on your own"

## Corrections Made

### 1. Prime Minister Database (mp_matcher_corrected.py)

**Issue**: Hardcoded Prime Minister dates were using approximate years instead of exact dates
**Fix**: Updated to use exact dates from UK Government official records (gov.uk)

#### Verified Dates from gov.uk:
- Winston Churchill: 1940-05-10 to 1945-07-26
- Clement Attlee: 1945-07-26 to 1951-10-26
- Winston Churchill (2nd term): 1951-10-26 to 1955-04-05
- Anthony Eden: 1955-04-05 to 1957-01-10
- Harold Macmillan: 1957-01-10 to 1963-10-18
- Alec Douglas-Home: 1963-10-18 to 1964-10-16
- Harold Wilson: 1964-10-16 to 1970-06-19
- Edward Heath: 1970-06-19 to 1974-03-04
- Harold Wilson (2nd term): 1974-03-04 to 1976-04-05
- James Callaghan: 1976-04-05 to 1979-05-04
- Margaret Thatcher: 1979-05-04 to 1990-11-28
- John Major: 1990-11-28 to 1997-05-02
- Tony Blair: 1997-05-02 to 2007-06-27

### 2. Test Cases Fixed

#### test_matching_improvements.py
- Changed test dates from exact transition dates to dates shortly after
  - "1979-05-04" → "1979-06-01" (for Thatcher)
  - "1997-05-02" → "1997-06-01" (for Blair)
- Added comments documenting why these changes were made
- Added notes for test cases that need verification against actual MP data

#### measure_matching_improvement.py
- Updated test dates to use dates when PMs were actually serving
- Added comments explaining the date choices

#### mp_matcher_advanced.py
- Fixed test case dates in the test function
- Added comments for clarity

### 3. Transition Date Handling

**Issue**: On exact transition dates (e.g., May 4, 1979), parliamentary debates might refer to either the outgoing or incoming PM depending on time of day
**Fix**: Modified title resolution to:
- Return lower confidence (0.7) on exact transition dates
- Add a note indicating the ambiguity
- Maintain high confidence (0.95) for dates clearly within a PM's term

### 4. Data Verification

All dates and facts have been verified against authoritative sources:
- Prime Minister dates: UK Government website (gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers)
- Churchill birth/death: 30 November 1874 - 24 January 1965 (verified)
- Thatcher birth/death: 13 October 1925 - 8 April 2013 (verified)
- Thatcher constituency: Finchley 1959-1992 (verified)
- Blair constituency: Sedgefield 1983-2007 (verified)
- Cameron start date: 11 May 2010 (verified)

### 5. Principles Established

1. **Never assume or infer data** - Always look up actual dates from authoritative sources
2. **Document sources** - Include source references in comments (e.g., "Data source: gov.uk")
3. **Handle ambiguity explicitly** - Acknowledge when we can't be certain (e.g., transition dates)
4. **Test with real data** - Use dates that can be verified against historical records
5. **Lower confidence when uncertain** - Better to be cautious than falsely confident

## Files Modified

1. `mp_matcher_corrected.py` - Created with verified dates and improved transition handling
2. `test_matching_improvements.py` - Fixed test dates and added verification notes
3. `measure_matching_improvement.py` - Updated test dates
4. `mp_matcher_advanced.py` - Fixed test case dates
5. `test_corrected_matcher.py` - Created to test corrections

## Remaining Considerations

- Some test cases marked as "VERIFY_MP" need checking against actual MP database
- OCR correction for "Mrs. O'Brien" correctly returns no match (no female O'Brien MPs in database)
- Ambiguous surname matching (Davies, Smith, etc.) correctly identifies multiple candidates

## Lessons Learned

This correction exercise reinforces the importance of:
- Using authoritative sources for all historical data
- Not making assumptions about dates or facts
- Building systems that acknowledge uncertainty
- Thorough testing with real-world data
